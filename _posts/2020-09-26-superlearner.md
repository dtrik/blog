## Introduction
This is a summary of the book The Only Skill that Matters by Jonathan A. Levi.

## Thesis
In today's fast paced world - learning new things quickly is the most important skill. The book doesn't delve deep into proving this but accepting it, it explains how somebody - especially an adult - can learn new things fast. We can utilize all the evolutionary quirks for the modern life. The book doesn't really reveal any new tricks but does a holistic survey of the learning landscape and provides a flow to learn.

## Evolution 
Our brains are really good at remembering smells, tastes and sights. These were crucial in determinding whether your species survived to the next day or not. Avoiding poisonous food, predators and recognizing the social group were all crucial for survival. These instincts persist. Smells can trigger extremely detailed memories. We also remember locations to an almost absurd level of detail. While reading this book, I tried recalling different rooms I have been. I was quite shocked to realise that I remember some houses and their layouts that I have been to once about 15 years back. We can leveraging these evolutionary insticts to learn new things and remember them.

## Adult Learning 
The book refers to the research of Malcolm Knowles on how adults learn. An important change on learning once we become adults is knowing why we learn. As children, learning is done usually on demand. The whys and hows are not considered that important. But as we become adults, learning happens best through active practice and participation. The brain has to be convinced that the knowledge is immediately useful. This can hinder but als can be used to accelerate learning.

Knowles suggests the following:
1. Start with a problem and work towards a solution
2. Customize the path to learning according to your requirements. 
3. Internal motivation is important - dive deep into the why. 
4. Plan ahead to structure the sequence of learning

From Tim Ferris:
1. break into smallest chunks 
2. pick minimal subset that has maximal use - Pareto principle
3. find best order to learn
4. use psychology or social pressure to incentivise fast learning 
While planning ahead focus on the following:
1. Why are you learning?
2. What level of knowledge is needed
3. How to break into smaller chunks and how to recombine
4. What are the most important things to learn
5. What is the right order of learning
6. How is the information accessed - organize access and information properly
7. What is the study schedule and how can it be compressed - add real world stakes
8. How can progress be measured - SMART goals
9. What happens if things don't go according to plan - prepare for failure
Harry Lorayne(*) - memory specialist
Master the visual memory - *imagine pictures for learning*
Highly detailed visualisations - each detail can be used to represent something new
Images should be bizarre, absurd, violent or sexual - hippocampus loves the abnormal
Create connections with existing knowledge
Create logical connnections to what we are learning
Memory palaces are like a nuclear option to remembering
Our brains have an incredible ability to store locations we have been to - it is a very effective
anchoring point for memory. 
Anchor visualisations to specific areas in the palace
Next step is to use Spaced Repetition for memories to stick - spacing effect and lag effect 
combine to enable long term memories. 
To read effectively use SQ3R - survey, question, read, recall, review
During survey, skim the material to prime the brain for receiving information 
During questioning, answer the whys of learning. This creates curiousity for reading. 
Then read, either fast or normal.
After reading, recall to improve details of visualization and mnemonics. Depending on density, 
this might be needed every paragraph or less frequently. 
Finally during review, analyze the content from multiple perspectives. Connect it to previous 
knowledge. 

During pre-read, build a mental map of the material. Form markers and anchor points, get a general
picture of what is being covered. This also involves questioning - utilize cognitive bias to 
trick the brain into interest. Why are we reading, how is useful. 

Speed reading needs to be regularly practice - decide if something has to be speed read or not
Minimize subvocalisation - very hard to do
Reduce the number of times spent in saccadic blindness - train to reduce the number of fixations.
Schultz table (*). 
Optimize fixations. Focus on optimally spaced words in a line. Use progressive workload to learn 
this. Read at speed you are barely comprehending, then train to read at this speed and when it 
becomes comprehensible increase speed to next level - like physical training. 

Before speed-reading, do survey and questioning. After speed reading, pause to make visual markers
and then recall and review. Then revisit with spaced repetitiion. 

Learning many things together is not really bad. Learning anything helps in learning everything. 
Jump around and get ideas from everywhere. If something is difficult to understand, approach it 
from another angle. Variety is important in learning. Brute force learning. 

Checking comprehension is another important step in learning. Bloom's hierarchy of learning has 
the steps in which learning happens. First is remembering, then comes understanding, then comes 
analyzing, then comes evaluating and finally comes creation. Only at the last stage have to truly
mastered something. For this, testing is important. Tests are most useful when it involves 
applying what we learnt. Purdue studied showed tests/quizzes involving inference and analysis 
from material learnt is better for overall learning than just continuing study. One way to apply
this is to use the material learnt from day one. Instead of waiting for an arbitrary threshold, 
use it and then evaluate if our usage was correct. For eg, speak a new language from day 1. One
more way is to write blogs/ proper teaching requires proper understanding.   

Teaching is one of the most effective ways of testing ourselves. It forces us to check our 
understanding due to the psychological effect. It also requires us to move up the Bloom's 
heirarchy to teach correctly. It can result in identifying knowledge gaps as well as new insights
from the other person. Only if you can explain something simply have you learnt something well. 
Sleep, right food and exercise are the three most important things for our brain.
