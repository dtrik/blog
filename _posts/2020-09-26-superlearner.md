## Introduction
This is a summary of the book The Only Skill that Matters by Jonathan A. Levi.

## Thesis
In today's fast paced world - learning new things quickly is the most important skill. The book doesn't delve deep into proving this but accepting it, it explains how somebody - especially an adult - can learn new things fast. We can utilize all the evolutionary quirks for the modern life. The book doesn't really reveal any new tricks but does a holistic survey of the learning landscape and provides a flow to learn.

## Evolution 
Our brains are really good at remembering smells, tastes and sights. These were crucial in determinding whether your species survived to the next day or not. Avoiding poisonous food, predators and recognizing the social group were all crucial for survival. These instincts persist. Smells can trigger extremely detailed memories. We also remember locations to an almost absurd level of detail. While reading this book, I tried recalling different rooms I have been. I was quite shocked to realise that I remember some houses and their layouts that I have been to once about 15 years back. We can leveraging these evolutionary insticts to learn new things and remember them.

## Adult Learning 
The book refers to the research of Malcolm Knowles on how adults learn. An important change on learning once we become adults is knowing why we learn. As children, learning is done usually on demand. The whys and hows are not considered that important. But as we become adults, learning happens best through active practice and participation. The brain has to be convinced that the knowledge is immediately useful. This can hinder but also can be used to accelerate learning.

Knowles suggests the following:
1. Start with a problem and work towards a solution
Instead of starting from the basics (eg. "Hello World" in programming) and eventually reaching a point where you use it for a complicated task, go the other way round. Pick a problem you are interested in solving in the area of learning and then learn as required. This provides immediate feedback and at the same time keeps things interesting.

2. Customize the path to learning according to your requirements
Some things are necessary, some are not. While learning from a structured plan, try to figure out the most important things and learn them. Learn a few optional things, ignore a few for later. Take different paths, don't stick rigidly to an external plan.

3. Internal motivation is important
External motivation is not effective after a point. Instead, as adults we have to motivate ourselves to learn something. For this, we have to deeply introspect on why we want to learn it - dive deep into the why.

4. Plan ahead to structure the sequence of learning
This is very important, instead of just pushing ahead without a plan, first structure what and how we are learning. While planning ahead focus on the following:

     a. Why are you learning?
     - include why you are learning into your plan
     
     b. What level of knowledge is needed?
     - knowing enough to teach someone vs knowing enough to pass an exam
     
     c. How to break into smaller chunks and how to recombine?
     - learn the smallest chunks (eg. words in a language) and then combine them to form bigger useful chunks (eg. sentences)
     
     d. What are the most important things to learn?
     - Pareto Principle: 20% of the information might cover 80% of our requirement
     
     e. What is the right order of learning?
     - structuring the order is important, the wrong order might have have permanent effect on our learning

     f. How is the information accessed - organize access and information properly?
     - the information we learn should be easily accessible and in the most useful order (eg. remembering what an array is before sorting an array)
     
     g. What is the study schedule and how can it be compressed?
     - Parkinson's Principle - work expands to fill the schedule, reverse this. Adding real world stakes might be helpful in compressing the schedule, by tricking our brain (eg. a public lecture on a topic within 2 weeks for a topic that you think might take you 4 weeks)
     
     h. How can progress be measured?
     - pick SMART goals. Specific Measurable Achievable Realistic and Timely (eg. learn 100 German verbs in 2 weeks is a SMART goal, learn German in 2 weeks is not)
     
     i. What happens if things don't go according to plan?
     - things might not go according to plan. Our learning path should be tolerant to failure. A single missed study session should not result in the entire schedule getting thrown out. 

## Memory
For learning anything, the memory is really important. A blind devotion to just memorising is not useful in learning. But being able to recall the required chunks easily is extremely beneficial. The bigger the chunk that can be recalled, the more we can learn.

Barring neurological disorders, anyone can memorise if it is done in the right manner. Based on neuroscience research, the only difference between the memory specialists, the ones who can recall the order of a shuffled deck after going through it once, and us is how the brain recalls information. The brain itself doesn't change.

This is a positive because it means a majority of us can learn to memorise. This is in fact the subject of the book Moonwalking with Einstein in which a memory sceptic learns the tricks of the trade and becomes a very proficent memory expert (6th in an international compettition) within a year.

The trick is to master the visual memory. Use highly detailed visualisations - each detail can be used to represent something new. The images should be bizarre, absurd, violent or sexual - our hippocampi (the part of the brain that acts as a memory filter and cleaner) loves the abnormal. Involve as many senses to that memory as possible - taste, smell, touch. The more vivid the visualisation, the stronger the connection. This visualisation requires regular practice but it is something most people can do. 

While visualising and learning, we should create connections with existing knowledge. As an example, while learning a word in a new language, connect it to a word in a language we already know in a very vivid manner. 

Another important step is to always keep in mind what we are learning. Just remembering vivid pictures are not useful by themselves. It should form a logical connection to our overall body of knowledge.

Memory palaces, also referred to as Method of Loci, are a very effective way of remembering. Our brains have an incredible ability to store locations/rooms we have been to. I am not going into the details here as it is a very popular method, in fiction and not. An important thing to be considered here is that it could be too effective and permanent. If you create a memory palace in an order, modifying it later could be very hard. So, plan ahead. 

The next part of any discussion in memory is to ensure that the required memories are long term. Everyone forgets, it is an important part of being human. Remembering everything whether it is important or not is really not useful. Spaced Repetition - review just when you are about to forget - is a proven way to ensure that the required memories stick. There are software and physical systems for implementing spaced repetition. 

## Reading
To learn something new, we have to read. Effective reading is thus an important step in learning new things. To read effectively use the SQ3R method - Survey Question Read Recall Review

While surveying, skim the material to prime the brain for receiving information. During this skimming, pick the important headings, key points, terminologies.

Then question yourself on why you are reading that part. This creates curiousity for reading. 

The above two are together referred to as pre-reading, This also involves questioning - utilize cognitive bias to trick the brain into interest. Why are we reading, how is it useful. At this time, build a mental map of the material. Form markers and anchor points, get a general picture of what is being covered and how it is structured.

Then read the section, it can either be speed-reading or normal reading. At this time, create vivid visualisations at the anchor points.

After reading, recall to improve details of visualization and mnemonics. Depending on how dense the content is, this might be needed every paragraph or less frequently.

Finally during review, analyze the content from multiple perspectives. Connect it to previous 
knowledge. 

### Speed reading
Once you learn to speed read, you are not going to jump to 5000 words per minute and zoom through War and Peace in an hour. But you can still significantly raise your reading speed. 600-800 words per minute while retaining 80-90% comprehension are possible. But like most skills, it is something that can rust without use. So regularly practice it and also decide if something has to be speed read. Speed reading a very interesting novel might ruin the thrill. The following are the primary ways to improve your reading speed significantly:
1. Minimize subvocalisation - Completely removing subvocalisation is impossible. So attempt to reduce it such that you are subvocalising the most important words in a line. It is still very hard to do. 
2. When we read, our eyes jump around and each jump results in a period of blindness. This is imperceptible and is referred to as a saccade. To increase your reading speed, reduce the number of times spent in saccadic blindness. This can be done by training to reduce the number of fixations. The Schultz table is used for this.
3. Optimize fixations. Focus on optimally spaced words in a line. Use progressive workload to learn this. Read at speed you are barely comprehending, then train to read at this speed and when it becomes comprehensible increase speed to next level - this is much like physical training, where as we are able to lift a particular weight, it is increased to the next level. 

## Cross-pollination
Another interesting idea that comes up here is brute-force learning. Just like how in brute-force hacking, a system is hacked into by trying out all possible options, we can hack our brains into learning something by learning from all possible options. An insight in biology might help somewhere in computer science.

Learning many things together is also not really bad. Learning anything helps in learning everything. Jump around and get ideas from everywhere. If something is difficult to understand, approach it from another angle. Variety is important in learning. 

## Levels of Learning
 Bloom's taxonomy of learning has the steps in which learning happens. First is remembering, then comes understanding, then comes analyzing, then comes evaluating and finally comes creation. Only at the last stage have to truly mastered something. Moving from the first to the last level is the difference between a high school student and a doctoral candidate.

## Testing

Testing is an extremely important process in learning. It helps in differentiating between recognition and remembering. This could be a structured test by an authority. But tests are most useful when it involves applying what we learnt. There is research which proved that tests or quizzes involving inference and analysis from the material learnt are better for overall learning than just continuing study.

One way to achieve this is to use the material learnt from day one. Instead of waiting for an arbitrary threshold of learning, use it and then evaluate if our usage was correct. Feedback loops are important. As an example, while learning a new language, practice speaking from day 1. Another way of testing our learning is to write blogs - a quality blogpost requires understanding.

## Teaching 

Teaching is one of the most effective ways of testing ourselves. It forces us to check our 
understanding due to the psychological effect. It also requires us to move up the Bloom's 
taxonomy to teach correctly. It can result in identifying knowledge gaps as well as new insights
from the other person. Only if you can explain something simply have you learnt something well. 

## Brain fuel
All the above are completely wasteful if our brain is not maintained properly. Thus the three most important things for learning are:
1. Sleep: our brains need rest. While sleeping, connections are strengthened and the unnecessary things are cleaned. Without proper sleep, learning is impossible
2. Right food: the brain consumes about 20% of our daily enery despite weighing only 0.2%. Keeping it chugging is thus a taxing activting. High quality fats provide optimum nutrition for the brain. Consuming lots of sugars on the other hand can have a detrimental effect
3. Exercise: there is a lot of research that exercise improves the neurochemistry.

## Summary
Learning new things fast is the most important skill. Utilise the evolutionary traits to remember long-term. Adults might need to convince our brains that learning something new is important immediately. Plan ahead before learning. Memory is important and trainable. Read effectively (SQ3R). Learn in as many ways as possible. Test your learning, teaching is the most effective way to test it. Your brain needs sleep, right food and exercise for optimal functioning. 

## Book Review
I liked the book. All the usual suspects were touched upon and I didn't learn anything new from it. But it is structured well and is densely packed with information. I took most of the claims at face value and did not do a review of the associated research but it felt sensible. I would recommend you to read it and incorporate parts into your life.
