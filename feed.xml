&lt;p&gt;Before jumping into my recap - Everton (A), this is how our season had gone so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;august&quot;&gt;August:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fm_till_nov2019/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my experiment from the Chelsea game onwards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;september&quot;&gt;September:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fm_till_nov2019/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rage-quit in the Atletico (A) game so that is a blackmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;october&quot;&gt;October:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fm_till_nov2019/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lille were really lucky in their home game to escape with a point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;november&quot;&gt;November:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fm_till_nov2019/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drew to Chelsea after Robertson inexplicably decided to just stand still and let Tammy Abraham take the ball from the halfway line and stand still. The City home loss was hard. We created sufficient shots but no really good chances. Matip made a massive blunder under little pressure and we conceded from that. It was a fairly even match though Cancelo was very threatening. The Atletico home match was enjoyable because Deigo Costa went mad almost immediately after equalising for them and got himself sent off for a two-footed lunge on Van Dijk. They were hanging on to the draw but I somehow managed to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As things stand, we are top of our CL group and 2nd in the league (4 points behind City). The loss to City at home might prove costly. Hopefully we will be getting a favourable draw in CL knockouts. LOSC play Atletico next and I am hoping LOSC win so that I can avoid Atletico forever. I doubt it would happen though. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;everton-vs-liverpool&quot;&gt;Everton vs Liverpool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team comes into this match after the 2 bruising encounters against City and Atletico Madrid respectively. This is a must win game, both for keeping City’s lead down to 4 points as well as the importance of my first derby. Most of the first team is fatigued and I have to make do with the rotated squad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-match-opposition-report&quot;&gt;Pre-Match Opposition Report&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My scouts indicate that the following is their likely lineup and formation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fm_till_nov2019/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is Everton, they have a lot of weaknesses (&lt;em&gt;lol&lt;/em&gt;), and one of the notable weaknesses mentioned in the scouting report is their vulnerability to crosses. Though their central defenders are good, it makes sense because of the aggressive nature of both flanks. WB–IF is a very aggressive combo and in addition they have Sigurdsson who is also an attacking player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-approach&quot;&gt;My Approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to put two players in the DM strata, an Anchor to handle their AM or IFs while I attack that flank and another DM as an aggressive playmaker - Regista. I placed another playmaker between their defence and midfield – AP(S). I used a FB(S)-W(A) combo on my right wing to target their weaker left wing and went for a FB(S)-IW(S) combo on the left wing.
I started like this but immediately swapped Keita and Chirivella as the former is a more natural DM. Origi played as a PF(A).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fm_till_nov2019/image6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-match&quot;&gt;Post Match&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what was the result?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fm_till_nov2019/image7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty good! :) 
And this is with my rotated squad so I am really happy about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really dominated them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fm_till_nov2019/image8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keita had a great game and really imposed himself on the game. He had 6 key passes out of which one got converted and 2 dribbles. He came away the player of the match. Chirivella also had a good game and his assist kickstarted the game. Both Matip and Origi got on the scoresheet from cross assists, one a freekick (Chirivella) and another from Wijnaldum, the AP(S).  AOC, my W(A) had 10 dribbles! So at least a few elements of what I wanted came through in this match. Final ratings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fm_till_nov2019/image9.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mission accomplished, City’s lead kept manageable and Everton kept quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the latest edition of Football Manager when it came on sale recently. I had already put in a lot of hours without getting properly into the game, mainly because of several match engine quirks which were disrupting my enjoyment. That is when I stumbled upon this &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.sigames.com/topic/486970-tactics-gymnastics-lyon/&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; in the SI Forums about using formations and roles to counter teams instead of setting a fixed formation as I have been doing till now. It sounded interesting so I gave it go with my Liverpool save (I almost always play as Liverpool).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to document my thought process on how I approached games and the results. It is for both slowing down my play as well as to learn to play. I generally end up zooming through a season and find myself not enjoying or getting angry at results. Hopefully, this will slow down as dumping words onto the internet is going to be time consuming. (Fair warning, I did rage quit twice against a team (ATM) and asked my assistant manager to handle that game instead. I won’t be discussing that game and will mark it as a failure in my self-appraisal.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Liverpool squad in FM20 is really good though a bit short on depth at the back. Despite this, I sold Lovren to China. I also sent Lallana on loan to Milan as we have sufficient numbers up front and it is his last year of contract. (Also I am not a big fan of either).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead I got in Kristoffer Ajer (CB) and Birger Meling (DL) as backups. I expect both will play sufficient minutes as we are involved in multiple competitions. My best XI after the sales and the transfers in is still the same Liverpool XI that has generally lined up this season IRL - Salah, Mane, Firmino, Wijnaldum, Hendo, Fabinho, TAA, Gomez, Van Dijk and Robbo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tactical-framework&quot;&gt;Tactical Framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As second favourites for the title, I want to impose a style of play while keeping formations and roles fluid to counter the opposition. The aim is to put my playmakers in space and let the roles and formations handle the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want my team to play fast flowing football. The players should make good movement off the ball to receive in space and play at a higher tempo. I used the higher defensive line and engagement to mimic the higher press. I am not particularly good at FM or tactics so this is just my attempt. It seems to be working till now though that could be either a fluke or just the high quality players at my disposal making it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team instructions are set to the following, and I have made minimal changes to it till now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fm_intro/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this experiment after the first PL match of the season and I am currently in November of the same season. I am not planning to recap every single match, I will mostly do one or two every game-month. For the games I review, I will try to include a pre and post-match report. The first will indicate why I tried what I did and the second will indicate what happened and how much is likely to be influenced by my tactics.
Edit: I ended up doing exactly one after this. :cries&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">About tinkering in FM</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Conda Quicknotes</title><link href="https://dtrik.github.io/blog/2019/10/28/conda-instructions.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Conda Quicknotes" /><published>2019-10-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-10-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://dtrik.github.io/blog/2019/10/28/conda-instructions</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dtrik.github.io/blog/2019/10/28/conda-instructions.html">&lt;p&gt;This is a short post with a few Conda commands and notes. I am adding my most frequently using commands. Use carefully, YMMV. I am sourcing 
these from the Conda Docs&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It is mainly intended as a quick reference for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basics-and-introduction&quot;&gt;Basics and Introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conda is a package and environment manager primarily for Python. For our current context, it helps in installing packages while 
resolving their dependencies. Conda also helps in creating environments which I think of as isolated boxes with their own set of 
versions of packages (and even python).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can switch across environments without worrying if installing a new package will create conflicts. For eg, a new package C might 
need version x.x of package B while an already existing package A needs version x.y. Without environments, this could lead to 
dependency issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This environment information is also useful when we share our issues/packages etc where we can specify exactly which version of each 
package is required to either reproduce our problem or to install and work properly on our package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conda requires an Anaconda (or Miniconda) installation. Once it is installed on Windows, all the conda commands are accessible from the 
Anaconda Prompt which can be invoked from the Start Menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To verify that conda is available, check:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;conda --version
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To update to lastest version of conda:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;conda update conda
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;most-used-commands&quot;&gt;Most used commands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a new environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;conda create --name myenv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates an environment with the same python version as the Anaconda installation. To create an environment with a different version
of python (say 3.5):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;conda create --name myenv python=3.5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These create environments with a default set of packages. 
To create an environment of python 3.5 and installing a particular package of required version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;conda create --name myenv package_name=version python=3.5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to install all the packages required in an environment in one go. 
To activate the created environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;conda activate myenv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go back to base environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;conda activate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install a package using conda:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Search for the package&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; conda search package_name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install the package&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; conda install package_name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verify it is installed&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; conda list
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also use pip along with conda. To use pip in the environment, first install pip:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;conda install -n myenv pip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conda and pip can have conflicts. So install as much as possible using conda. Other recommendations can be seen from &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#using-pip-in-an-environment&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove an environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;conda remove --name myenv --all
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the basic commands that I think should be most useful. If I find more commands, I will update this post.&lt;/p&gt;

The latest rage in 
these circles, at least according to Medium, is Journaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several nice articles about Journaling and its benefits, especially from &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/journaling-one-sentence&quot;&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://benjaminhardy.com/journal/&quot;&gt;Ben Hardy&lt;/a&gt;. There is an overload of information about it. Seriously! Anyway these two are 
my favourites. Since I like to imagine myself writing, journaling is tempting. Unlike other self-improvement activities, it is 
taxing only the brain. I think I will have a go at it. I don’t feel comfortable writing in a notebook, nor am I comfortable putting 
it on the servers of a random dotcom. So I think I will write my thoughts in plaintext in Emacs. Not very secure, I know, so I will 
find a way that it is backed up securely.
I plan to devote half an hour every day before sleeping. I will keep the timing flexible as I usually end up quitting when I miss
out on a day or two. I haven’t decided what is to be my aim for journaling, so I will do some more research and keep that flexible 
till then. Lets see how all this goes. Becoming a 10X person is certainly the goal ;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am undecided on what to write next. I will update this soon.&lt;/p&gt;

It is vaguely interesting that in more than 10 years of infrequent blogging,
I have very rarely mentioned this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t even point to a point where I became interested in music. My family
has its fair share of decent musicians though only a few are really good at it. But most of us can carry a tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up 
listening to cassette tapes and All India Radio and Chitrahaar. I think I must have heard Venkateshwara Suprabhatam and 
Mahishasura Marddini Sthothram pretty much every day till I was 18 or so, rather frequently even later. All those songs, devotional
or not are interwoven tightly in the fairly idyllic tapestry of my pre-adulthood life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved to Calicut for college, a Philips MP3 player was amongst my most prized possessions! I carried with me all those songs
from my childhood. I had also somehow acquired a taste for Malayalam songs and Carnatic music. Both my best friends were music
aficionados, one a long-time practitioner as well! It was great fun. I was properly introduced to Western music at this juncture. 
Till then, my knowledge extended to the drumming chorus of “We will rock you” and Blues. I had of course
heard my fair share of Mozart but Metallica or Guns’n’Roses were all new to me. Sampling an entirely new course of music was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One difference I noticed is the differential role of instruments between Indian and Western music. In Indian music, instruments are background. Barring a few famous practitioners, instrumentalists are the seasoning than the main course. Songs also have instruments as transitional elements or garnishing than in its own right. I am limited by my listening comprehension but I also feel the lyrics being prominent in Indian music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering where I am going with this. Coming to the point, one of my motivations for learning ML/DL was in its application to music. I want study the above hypotheses. I also want to learn how to classify music to &lt;em&gt;raagas&lt;/em&gt;. All these are areas I will focus attention on once I have a firm grasp on the topics involved. Concluding my rambling post on that note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I will write about the journaling system I want to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;

I just felt too sleepy. I think I need to schedule a particular time in the day where regardless of what 
else is happening, I write. Anyway, today I will write some stuff about my love towards electronic stuff. No, this is not a statement of 
purpose begging some university to give me admission because look I always loved electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been always more of a windowshopping type of love because goddamn they are expensive! Still, I have owned two laptops, two
kindles, one desktop, multiple phones (one iOS, three Android and three feature phones), two music players (one iPod and one mp3
player) and wow that is a lot considering I am yet to hit my 30th birthday and that all of this was collected after my 18th 
birthday. Dare I say this is still lower than most people I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still there is a lot of stuff I have missed out on that most white people I know seem to have owned, notably a gaming console and
an iPad. I am not a big fan of gaming consoles as I find the handheld controller fairly clunky as compared to the mouse and 
keyboard combination. The iPad is definitely on my list though! I am especially a big fan of the Pencil. Similarly another thing
that makes me interested is the Remarkable Tablet. Both these tablets target my requirement of being able to write and annotate on whatever I
am reading. I am definitely gonna wheedle the iPad (+pencil) out of someone, the iPad Mini is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway that is a delayed update and I am definitely gonna post something tomororw. I have to decide what it is going to be though.
It might be about music.&lt;/p&gt;

sights&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#myfootnote1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This post is a tiny window (strictly G-rated) into our trip - the 
trek&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#myfootnote2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to the Taktsang Monastery in Paro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While hashing out an itinerary, Taktsang or Tiger’s Nest as it is referred to in English was a tiny debating point. On the one 
hand it is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in Bhutan. On the other hand, a trek isn’t usually part of a honeymoon.
We finally ended up deciding that it was too important a place to skip just for convention’s sake. That proved to be a good
decision as despite the difficulties, it proved more than equal to its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were three main cities that were part of our itinerary and Paro was the last point in our sojourn in Bhutan. 
It was also the most beatiful place we saw. It is amazing how much Paro looks like something out of a postcard. Lush 
green paddy fields, tiny town centre with beatiful buildings, a majestic fort that is lit up at night and even a tiny river!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached Paro from Thimphu after a tiny detour to see the famous Dochula Pass the evening of the day before the one we had 
dedicated for the Taktsang trek. A late lunch and a mild yet superfun white water raft session later, we went to our hotel. As 
it was a fair distance from Paro proper, our driver came to pick us up for dinner and also some late night touristy stuff such as
pics of the aforementioned lit up fort. We then settled down back at our hotel in anticipation of next day’s trek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Complimentary) breakfast later, we were on our way. The Taktsang monastery is set on the cliffside and it looks impossibly 
high up. Our guide repeatedly advised us to not focus on how far away it looks and instead just walk as if we were out on a 
stroll. There is a flat fee of 500 Nu (1 Nu = 1 INR) per person for the trek paid at the base itself. Walking sticks in hand and 
caps to protect against the sun, we started the trek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trek is around 5 km to the top and is fairly easy with a few difficult sections for the beginner. There is a cafeteria 
midway and the second half is pretty easy except for a big set of staircases! But that is jumping ahead in the story. We went at 
a good pace for the first hour or so but then the OH who was on her first trek started huffing and puffing. The elevation 
is not that much to worry about oxygen et al but the terrain is fairly uneven. Our guide was fantastic at motivating and with 
lots of stories about the monastery as well as Buddhism in Bhutan we reached the midway point, the cafetaria. We rested for some 
time, had some coloured sugared carbonated water (Fanta ;)) and resumed the trek. We took the steeper but scenic route and soon 
the cliff wall that hosted the monastery was in our view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obligatory pics taken, we continued and soon hit the most anxiety-inducing part of the entire trek for me - a massive (700 steps)
set of staircase! The number itself was massive but the worst part was that it included a downhill and uphill stretch. So there 
was no luxury of only climbing in one direction T.T. We persevered (especially after seeing people twice or more our age doing 
the same) and reached the monastery. Keeping all our stuff in a locker room, we went through all the temples that are part of 
the monastery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a background, the monastery is dedicated to Padmasambhava or Guru Rinpoche, the enlightened master who brought Buddhism to 
Bhutan. He is said to have flown in from Tibet on a tiger and meditated at this spot for three years, three months, three weeks, 
three days and three hours. The mythos surrounding him and Taktsang are interesting and worth reading about. He is said to have 
meditated in a cave shaped like a triangular dagger. An interesting thing we saw was that the prasadam (religious offerings) are 
a type of conical cake and then whatever food that the devotees carry as offering. So we got Hide &amp;amp; Seek, fryums etc as prasadam,
a welcome relief!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent around an hour in the temple complex. By the time we went through all these temples, each involving a small set of 
stairs, our feet were a fine mess and each step felt like an ordeal. We then started back and after navigating THE STAIRS one 
more time, we were on the downward stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We again made towards the cafeteria and had a very late lunch. A word of advice, it is very expensive and better avoided. After 
lunch, we then hurried back as there were portents of rain and we didn’t want to be stuck (or sliding) on the gravelly and 
slippery path. After what it felt like ages, we reached downhill and could say we completed the Paro Taktsang Trek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing time curio shoppping later, we were off to our hotel. We didn’t even wait to have a proper dinner and just collapsed on
our bed. Phew that was such a relief. We returned the next day to Phuentsholing and then back home the day after but that is not 
a subject of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I will write about my love affair with gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;

Give me a handful of my favourite ones and I can spend the rest of my life rewatching them. I still end up
going
to more movies than I expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luca was one such movie. Till about half an hour before the show, I was under the impression that we were going to watch 
Article 15. I was not enthusiastic about either. The former because I didn’t know such a movie existed, the latter because of the 
rather
predictable “upper caste saviour” lens. Anyway I went for Luca knowing only that it has Tovino and Ahaana as the leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of might be spoiler-y (duh! what do you expect from a review) so beware if you are against that sort of thing. It is
also
a fairly irreverent review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has two storylines, one being the investigation of the death of a semi-famous artist due to unknown causes, the other being 
the
description of the events that lead to the aforementioned artist’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investigation is from the point of view of a random cop who is in the final stages of a fairly amicable divorce where both
parties appear to be self-sacrificing. The other storyline is in the form of the cop reading a diary sent to Luca from 
Nihaarika.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie begins with the police starting the investigation. The main cop stumbles upon a diary and he takes it back to his 
home
where he sleeps in a separate floor with a cat (belonging to past love who left him heartbroken). He reads the diary to sleep 
every night and we learn the story of Luca and Nihaarika.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learn that Luca is an eccentric artist with a social conscience but a short fuse (&lt;em&gt;cliche alert&lt;/em&gt;). He is also an orphan with
both parents passing away in a troubled manner leaving him with acute fear of death and the dead. 
Nihaarika is an industrial chemistry PhD student (&lt;em&gt;foreshadow klaxon&lt;/em&gt;) who has come to Kochi to stay with her uncle. She also 
has a troubled past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They meet at an art exhibition where they have a heated argument because Niha (as her loved ones call her) mocks an artwork 
designed
by Luca that looks like hung garbage from where they were standing (&lt;em&gt;hint&lt;/em&gt; it needed to be seen from a different PoV). They make
up
after she apologises and become friendly over a coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a spontaneous painting session, we learn that her uncle molested her and she justifiably carries that fear and 
resentment 
as she was made to promise never to reveal it to her mother by him. She moves in with him to get away from her uncle. Soon 
there 
are meetings with friends and guardians and mentors and they have a jolly good time while slowly falling in love with each 
other
(in a month). There are lighthearted arguments about his habit of sticking pencils in his ear and flipping pages with a licked 
finger (&lt;em&gt;foreshadow klaxon&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the story progresses, we have the inevitable scene where a drunk Luca confronts the evil uncle and soon confesses his love 
for
her. Later they are protesting a colony of poor people geting eviction orders from a rich construction company. When it proves
ineffective, they decide to paint the walls of the propery with the faces of those poor people getting evicted. But tragedy 
strikes and while they are running away from cops who spot them at the scene he blacks out. They learn
that he has the same terminal brain condition his mother passed away from and he has only a few months left. He predictably 
pushes
her away and she ends up going to Bangalore to her mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the main storyline, the investigation meanders along until suspicions of foul play start when they learn that Nihaarika also 
died a week before Luca and both died from the same poison. Then suspects are paraded and it switches attention from a friend of
Luca to the evil uncle to the rich construction company and so on. If you read till now you have a fair idea of what happened. 
Turns out the clever chemist created a painless poison as a means of helping her thanatophobic lover have a painless death. It 
is
applied on the pages of the diary she sent and he consumes it every time he flips a page. This is discovered when the cop’s cat
also dies after licking those pages and the estranged wife suggests scanning the book. They get back together in this morbid 
fashion and the movie ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-line-review&quot;&gt;One line review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A below average movie that could have been average but didn’t due to multple reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-a-one-line-review&quot;&gt;Not a one line review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a hint of a promise and the movie is not as bad as I make it seem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is above average despite my mocking. The foreshadowing was rather heavyhanded but it was still an interesting twist.
Tovino had a decent outing and looked &lt;em&gt;fire&lt;/em&gt;.
Ahaana also looked the part. A few characters where good, shoutout to the assistant cop who did what we all wanted to do and 
slapped the shit out of the evil uncle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dialogues were meh and the storyline of the cop should have been edited much more.
There were loads of superfluous scenes especially multiple long sequences where this guy gets out from his car in torrential 
rain and goes to his upstairs room while his wife peeks from the window. Bleh. All their interactions were so wooden. That 
entire storyline needed a drastic cropping. A 1.5 hour movie dragged into a 2.5 hour one. 
There are many cliches and the intended red herrings were very clunky.
I also feel that the ethics of euthanasia was not handled well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ugly&quot;&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acting was really bad. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I rate it is a 2/5 or a 5.5/10 movie. It could have been a 3/5 or a 6.5/10 movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~At the moment, I am struggling a bit on what I should write next, so I will update this post soon.~
I decided to write about a place we visited in Bhutan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Til Later&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">About red herrings and other fish</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Handi Gundi Betta</title><link href="https://dtrik.github.io/blog/2019/07/07/hgb-trek.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Handi Gundi Betta" /><published>2019-07-07T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-07-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://dtrik.github.io/blog/2019/07/07/hgb-trek</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dtrik.github.io/blog/2019/07/07/hgb-trek.html">&lt;p&gt;As promised yesterday, here is a short post about our trek at Handi Gundi Betta in Ramanagara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning for this trek happened fairly early through a WhatsApp group but it came to my realisation only a day or two 
before it. Our travel to Kerala for the weekend got cancelled due to the vagaries of the Tatkal allotment process. Since
we were stuck were anyway, I thought why not walk a few kilometers uphill to compensate for the sheer laziness I was going to 
indulge in for the rest of the weekend. The OH decided to start indulging earlier so it was just me with the rest of the gang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trek was intended to be an “Intro to Trekking” for the youngest of us all (the awesome planners from my 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://dtrik.github.io/dudhsagar/&quot;&gt;Dudhsagar&lt;/a&gt; blog procreated) and the now 5 year old was to be indoctrinated into the cult
with this trek. There were descriptions floating about it as being a Lazy Man’s Trek so it was to be the perfect gateway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to the story, I reached their place the night before as we were planning to leave by 6:30 in the morning. Handi Gundi 
Betta is around 80 km away (or as we Bangaloreans say, anything between 1.5 hours to few days away) on Mysore Road. It is not
that far from the famous Rasta Cafe. We were hoping to start trekking before the sun makes too much of a mess. The 8 of us 
(including aforementioned 5 year old) reached the tiny tiny tiny village at the base after following some spookily clear 
instructions on a blog (there were suspicions of a time-travelling Rohilettan being the author). We made a pitstop for light 
breakfast and started the hike from the parked cars by 830 or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions after the parking spot were not clear and when we hit two roads diverged in a yellow hill, we took the path more 
travelled by and that made all the difference (ha!)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#myfootnote1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was a winding track that ended up 
at the base of the hill and we started 
climbing. It didn’t appear to be a lazy man’s trek as there were fairly challenging stretches for a beginner (pretty much all of
us involved). I was starting to wonder if the Overton Window (or the equivalent) for laziness has shifted so far towards
activity. It was still not that bad and we toiled on and reached the top in around 2 hours with only a few breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view there was as fantastic as anticipated and as it was fairly overcast, with the wind it was splendid at the top. Given the
chance, I would have gladly slept the entire day there. We had the packed brunch of toast (cheese and otherwise) and eggs and 
spent some time just chatting. It has to be noted that we were completely alone and didn’t see even a single person anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few rounds of photos and panoramas (the usual touristy stuff), we started back. I usually find the descent harder than 
the climb as it feels like too much stress on the legs (after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtrik.github.io/jor-se-bolo/&quot;&gt;Vaishno Devi&lt;/a&gt; trip, my 
legs were randomly twitching for a few days). We were almost 3/4th of the way down when this guy suddenly popped up and asked wtf we were doing in Protected Forest Area. Ouch. Thankfully one of us could speak Kannada fluently so we were able to get out with a warning to not repeat. The guy looked pretty sketchy and we were wondering if he was out for a quick buck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the trek 
and the area itself is restricted access with permission only. He told us that there is a board and everything and we were 
confused as we didn’t see anything of that sort. Turns out we took a completely wrong route and the start point was at a 
different side of the hill itself. We went down along the route he indicated and sure enough there was a board although it was 
completely in Kannada. It would have been much better and dare I say more effective if the board was situated better instead of 
right at the base of the hill (the spot where we parked cars would have been a more sensible choice). We then had to backtrack
a little because the route to the car was through a different way. We finally reached back at the car and started back to boring
old Bangalore. We had a very late lunch and a round of confused Mafia. I then hightailed back home as it was already very late 
and my dear OH must have been sneham vidarthinikkal at the poomukhavathilkkal for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bit lucky that we took the wrong turn as we would not have done the trek (none of us would break the law 
just for a joy). Though the primary motive was not achieved (5 y.o. just wanted to be back at the car), it was a good day out
with the gang. The trek was fun and a good workout and the food was superb. Shoutout to everyone involved for the great day. 
I will update this later with a few pics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I will write a review about Luca, a Malayalam movie released recently that we saw last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Til Later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;myfootnote1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I am inordinately proud of this reference :D&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">About illicit treks</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Summer of Data Science</title><link href="https://dtrik.github.io/blog/2019/07/06/SoDS.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Summer of Data Science" /><published>2019-07-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-07-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://dtrik.github.io/blog/2019/07/06/SoDS</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dtrik.github.io/blog/2019/07/06/SoDS.html">&lt;p&gt;I am taking part in the Summer of Data Science this time. Details about what it is can be found at this excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2018/05/28/summer-of-data-science-2018-sods18-launch-day/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. 
Summarising the idea, it involves picking a topic or course or book in the broad domain of data science and working on it over a period of 
3 months (a summer), typically June-July-August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made an attempt at this last summer but ended up not doing anything. I want to do better (not that hard to be fair!). So this time, I made
the pledge publicly and have picked the latest version of the two Fast.Ai courses - &lt;a href=&quot;https://course.fast.ai/part1&quot;&gt;Practical Deep Learning for Coders&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://course.fast.ai/part2&quot;&gt;Deep Learning from the Foundations&lt;/a&gt;. Do check out &lt;a href=&quot;fast.ai&quot;&gt;fast.ai&lt;/a&gt; for more details about the course 
including materials covered and the teaching philosophy itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I made the pledge last month and did make several inroads, it hasn’t been consistent. So I am restarting it starting tomorrow. There
are 14 lessons and about 30 hours of videos. I am planning to complete two lectures a week starting tomorrow. So I hope to complete the 
lessons within ~1.5 months. When I say complete two lectures a week, I mean I will be watching the lectures and making notes, then going 
through the lesson materials and (Jupyter) notebooks. I am also going to post a summary of what I worked on each day. I might make a 
separate page detailing these as I do not want those posts to interfere with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dtrik.github.io/motivation/&quot;&gt;my one pomodoro a post idea&lt;/a&gt;. 
I aim to finish all this in at most 2 months. I am planning to invest 2 hours at least every weekday on this (weekends intermittently).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to form ideas on how I can utilize this learning for my work and spend the rest of the time (~1 month) on this as well as trying out
Kaggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my next post tomorrow, I will write a short post about a trek we did at Handi Gundi Betta today (July 6th, 2019) as well as a funny 
incident that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
