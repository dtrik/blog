    <p>“Rhino- check”</p>

<p>“Duck-billed platypus- check”</p>

<p>“Clown fish- check”, God counted in a very satisfied voice. Heaven was a very busy place at the moment as all the holy ones had gotten 
together to look at God’s latest  craze- a Lego collection to rival Satan. He even had breathed life into his models and the things were 
looking quite impressive. “What say you, my dear fellow? Unable to eat anything because you still can’t digest that my collection is 
better than yours?” asked God. “Not bad, considering that you spent the better part of the last 7 years since I threw my Lego collection
party trying to make your own”. “7 years! No man, I have been doing this only for the last 7 days. In fact most of the things were made 
within a day”</p>

<p>And that my dear friends is how exaggeration was born.</p>

<p>Exaggeration- what a beautiful word, what a beautiful idea. I would not be exaggerating if I said that this is one activity, nay art 
that I am a champion at. Being a champion of this art as well as this cause, it is my honour-bound duty to instruct those less able than
me on this. As I said, exaggeration is not something that everyone is good at. It requires careful planning and innovation. Keeping that
poker-face while making that outlandish claim is not simple. Even inventing those outlandish claims is very difficult. There are several
unwritten rules which will help you get away with exaggeration. Here you are. Read and study.</p>

<h2 id="rule-number-1">Rule Number 1</h2>

<p>Multiply by n rule. If arbitrarily increasing a count introduces a twist in the tale in your favour, that count should be multiplied by
n (which is usually 10). So the next time you tell about your marks or the number of goals in Legendary mode against Barcelona with 
Sheffield United, just add that extra zero and enjoy the zing in your tale.</p>

<h2 id="rule-number-2">Rule Number 2</h2>

<p>Divide by n rule. If arbitrarily decreasing a count introduces a twist in the tale in your favour, that count should be divided by n. 
God is one of the eminent people to have perfected the use of this rule. Note: This rule is particularly effective when combined with 
rule number 1.</p>

<p>The above two rules were actually discovered in Ancient Greece while trying to encourage the Greek soldiers waiting for Xerxes army. 
3000 Spartans suddenly became 300 and 5000 Persians suddenly became 50000.</p>

<h2 id="rule-number-3">Rule Number 3</h2>

<p>Eyewitness rule. You always witness everything worth witnessing. The Counter Strike match which lasted 10 days or the athlete next door 
doing 150 push ups using his pinkie finger were all in your presence. Always.</p>

<h2 id="rule-number-4">Rule Number 4</h2>

<p>No names rule. As long as you don’t name names, you can’t be caught exaggerating. Pronouns were invented exactly for this reason. And 
people reciprocate when they know they have not been compromised. So it is always “You should have seen HIM eat. At least 30 Idlis!” And
“HE” will be more than glad to say something nice about you too.</p>

<h2 id="rule-number-5">Rule Number 5</h2>

<p>Swear on the name of every family member possible. A fine example would be “I swear by the last fur on the tail of my Great great 
grandfather’s favourite labrador that whatever I said happened.”</p>

<p>The above five rules should enable you to invent exaggerations. But the following rule is the most important one when it comes to 
getting away with it.</p>

<h2 id="rule-number-6">Rule Number 6</h2>

<p>Quote the Author rule. Quote Shakespeare or Bernard Shaw.  Or better Leo Tolstoy. No one reads those authors. While making claims, 
follow it up with a quote from one of the above mentioned authors.
“He was so angry that he beat up at least 10 people single-handedly. Like Tolstoy said in War and Peace, anger is the greatest friend 
you have. It can render you power to defeat even your greatest enemy.”</p>

<h2 id="rule-number-7">Rule Number 7</h2>

<p>This is the most important rule of all. Pray to Damu. Remember his wisdom. Think about all his greatest attempts. Get inspired by his 
exaggerations. Read his books on exaggeration. Whenever you feel doubtful, remember the golden rule that Damu knows everything. A good 
book to start with will be “100001 great exaggerations by Damu” ghost written by Damu.</p>

<p>The most important two rules are 6 and 7 and you will quickly notice that their product is 42. What? You don’t know what is special 
about 42? Just google “the answer to life the universe and everything”  and enjoy the beauty. Yes, the magic number strikes again. And
yes this is my 42nd post since I joined the blogosphere around 2 years ago. That it took me so long to reach this holy number is as much
a testament to my laziness as the chronic uncreativity that is present in me.
But there you are. For every creative, zestful, enthusiastic fool, you need a Damu to maintain the precarious balance of life. If you 
are reading this, thank you for persisting with such a lazy devil in the hope that he will come good. Hoping for many more blogs…</p>
