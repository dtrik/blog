    <p>I am not much of a writer, so theoretically, I should not be experiencing Writer’s Block. 
Rather it should be “Not much of a Writer’s Block”. But whatever it is, I must say the effects are pretty much the same. I can’t
think of anything sensible to write. If anyone finds this blog insensible and illogical, contact me, we can be good friends. 
So we start off. This time I will be telling about the hardships faced by an herbivore (junkivore would be more apt) in a 
carnivorous society.</p>

<p>Living all my life at home and occasional visits to the restaurant being with my parents, I had never faced the bias<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup> that 
vegetarians face. But once in college, the harsh reality became visible to my myopic eyes and I realised the magnitude of the 
bubble I was living in. The visits to restaurants began to become ordeals for a harmless grass-eater (eater not smoker) like me 
where I had to bear witness to my friends gorging on my fellow beings (sniff) while I had to sit helplessly watching an empty plate
(sniff sniff) awaiting my vegetarian food to be cooked which for some weird reason takes longer to cook than all other animals.</p>

<p>Phew! That was a long sentence, but I guess you can understand the passion with which I am writing this. Even after all that wait, 
the dish that comes will be cauliflower, which happens to be the “state north-Indian vegetable” (read: only dish; Gobi Manchurian,
Gobi fry, chilli Gobi… the list goes on) of Kerala.</p>

<p>The ordeal still doesn’t end. By this time the rest of the food would have 
finished and then I have to suffer the ignominy of having my food being handled around by still-hungry people. 
I had heard that 
community eating, where an entire family eats from a single plate, was present in Iran or some other country. I have to tell you my
dear friends; the custom is rampant in our dear motherland itself. It is prevalent in every single college of India too (at least 
in mine). My plate then becomes a battleground where the rest of the meat-eaters fight it out using their blood-stained hands while
I shake my head in despair trying to believe that I am still a vegetarian, though my food may have been tainted by blood.</p>

<p>If I thought that this bias was only in a mainly non-vegetarian Kerala, then I was sorely mistaken. I was made aware of the extreme
stupidity of my assumption on a recent visit to Tambiland (as my dear friend Arun says). It was a branch tour and I was among the
few vegetarians in the trip. There again I was met with the same hardships that I faced in God’s Own Country. Veg. Fried rice 
with chicken in it, a funny look on the waiter’s face when I told that I was vegetarian (was it pity I am yet unsure), waiting 
endlessly for paneer to come while chicken came hours back, these were just a few of my problems.</p>

<p>I almost lost my vegetarian 
virginity (:-) based on my assumption, nay hope that I have not yet consumed any flesh), several times, once with the previously
mentioned chicken veg. fried rice incident, another when I got chicken parantha instead of aloo parantha (the worst part was 
that I had to fight for my 5 Rs aloo parantha instead of the 20 Rs chicken parantha, which resulted in the MC guy starting to
doubt my sanity) and God alone knows how many other times.</p>

<p>This outburst comes at a time when I have completed a score successfully (Happy Birthday to me!!!) as a vegetarian (or 
lacto-ova-vegetarian for the purists (a naive assumption no doubt)). Of course, a major majority was spent in the safety of home.</p>

<p>Each coming day is now a struggle between me and the rest of the world as I try my level best to remain a vegan<sup><a href="#myfootnote2">2</a></sup>. I will be celebrating each vegan day with renewed vigour as I remain a member of the slowly becoming-extinct species of vegetarians. So protect me, campaign for me, make me a poster boy (bring on the cheerleaders) and vote for me.
Grandma, and mom this one is for you for inspiring me to remain a vegan.</p>

<p>Have I got over my “Not much of a writer’s block”? No idea.</p>

<p>PS: The braces are back with a bang.<br />
PPS: Life would be boring without exaggerations.<br />
PPPS: This last PS is just for you 4. Just to odd things out.</p>

<p><a name="myfootnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> Vegetarian life is very comfortable, no one will kill you for eating the wrong meat<br />
<a name="myfootnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> I thought vegan and vegetarian meant the same thing, I was old and foolish</p>
