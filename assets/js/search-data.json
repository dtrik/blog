            "title": "fastcore: An Underrated Python Library",
            "content": ". Background . I recently embarked on a journey to sharpen my python skills: I wanted to learn advanced patterns, idioms, and techniques. I started with reading books on advanced Python, however, the information didn&#39;t seem to stick without having somewhere to apply it. I also wanted the ability to ask questions from an expert while I was learning -- which is an arrangement that is hard to find! That&#39;s when it occurred to me: What if I could find an open source project that has fairly advanced python code and write documentation and tests? I made a bet that if I did this it would force me to learn everything very deeply, and the maintainers would be appreciative of my work and be willing to answer my questions. . And that&#39;s exactly what I did over the past month! I&#39;m pleased to report that it has been the most efficient learning experience I&#39;ve ever experienced. I&#39;ve discovered that writing documentation forced me to deeply understand not just what the code does but also why the code works the way it does, and to explore edge cases while writing tests. Most importantly, I was able to ask questions when I was stuck, and maintainers were willing to devote extra time knowing that their mentorship was in service of making their code more accessible! It turns out the library I choose, fastcore is some of the most fascinating Python I have ever encountered as its purpose and goals are fairly unique. . For the uninitiated, fastcore is a library on top of which many fast.ai projects are built on. Most importantly, fastcore extends the python programming language and strives to eliminate boilerplate and add useful functionality for common tasks. In this blog post, I&#39;m going to highlight some of my favorite tools that fastcore provides, rather than sharing what I learned about python. My goal is to pique your interest in this library, and hopefully motivate you to check out the documentation after you are done to learn more! . Why fastcore is interesting . Get exposed to ideas from other languages without leaving python: I’ve always heard that it is beneficial to learn other languages in order to become a better programmer. From a pragmatic point of view, I’ve found it difficult to learn other languages because I could never use them at work. Fastcore extends python to include patterns found in languages as diverse as Julia, Ruby and Haskell. Now that I understand these tools I am motivated to learn other languages. | You get a new set of pragmatic tools: fastcore includes utilities that will allow you to write more concise expressive code, and perhaps solve new problems. | Learn more about the Python programming language: Because fastcore extends the python programming language, many advanced concepts are exposed during the process. For the motivated, this is a great way to see how many of the internals of python work. | A whirlwind tour through fastcore . Here are some things you can do with fastcore that immediately caught my attention. . . Making **kwargs transparent . Whenever I see a function that has the argument **kwargs, I cringe a little. This is because it means the API is obfuscated and I have to read the source code to figure out what valid parameters might be. Consider the below example: . def baz(a, b=2, c =3, d=4): return a + b + c def foo(c, a, **kwargs): return c + baz(a, **kwargs) inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, **kwargs)&gt; . Without reading the source code, it might be hard for me to know that foo also accepts and additional parameters b and d. We can fix this with delegates: . def baz(a, b=2, c =3, d=4): return a + b + c @delegates(baz) # this decorator will pass down keyword arguments from baz def foo(c, a, **kwargs): return c + baz(a, **kwargs) inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, b=2, d=4)&gt; . You can customize the behavior of this decorator. For example, you can have your cake and eat it too by passing down your arguments and also keeping **kwargs: . @delegates(baz, keep=True) def foo(c, a, **kwargs): return c + baz(a, **kwargs) inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, b=2, d=4, **kwargs)&gt; . You can also exclude arguments. For example, we exclude argument d from delegation: . def basefoo(a, b=2, c =3, d=4): pass @delegates(basefoo, but= [&#39;d&#39;]) # exclude `d` def foo(c, a, **kwargs): pass inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, b=2)&gt; . You can also delegate between classes: . class BaseFoo: def __init__(self, e, c=2): pass @delegates()# since no argument was passsed here we delegate to the superclass class Foo(BaseFoo): def __init__(self, a, b=1, **kwargs): super().__init__(**kwargs) inspect.signature(Foo) . &lt;Signature (a, b=1, c=2)&gt; . For more information, read the docs on delegates. . . Avoid boilerplate when setting instance attributes . Have you ever wondered if it was possible to avoid the boilerplate involved with setting attributes in __init__? . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b ,c): self.a, self.b, self.c = a, b, c . Ouch! That was painful. Look at all the repeated variable names. Do I really have to repeat myself like this when defining a class? Not Anymore! Checkout store_attr: . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b, c): store_attr() t = Test(5,4,3) assert t.b == 4 . You can also exclude certain attributes: . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b, c): store_attr(but=[&#39;c&#39;]) t = Test(5,4,3) assert t.b == 4 assert not hasattr(t, &#39;c&#39;) . There are many more ways of customizing and using store_attr than I highlighted here. Check out the docs for more detail. . . Avoiding subclassing boilerplate . One thing I hate about python is the __super__().__init__() boilerplate associated with subclassing. For example: . class ParentClass: def __init__(self): self.some_attr = &#39;hello&#39; class ChildClass(ParentClass): def __init__(self): super().__init__() cc = ChildClass() assert cc.some_attr == &#39;hello&#39; # only accessible b/c you used super . We can avoid this boilerplate by using the metaclass PrePostInitMeta. We define a new class called NewParent that is a wrapper around the ParentClass: . class NewParent(ParentClass, metaclass=PrePostInitMeta): def __pre_init__(self, *args, **kwargs): super().__init__() class ChildClass(NewParent): def __init__(self):pass sc = ChildClass() assert sc.some_attr == &#39;hello&#39; . . Type Dispatch . Type dispatch, or Multiple dispatch, allows you to change the way a function behaves based upon the input types it receives. This is a prominent feature in some programming languages like Julia. For example, this is a conceptual example of how multiple dispatch works in Julia, returning different values depending on the input types of x and y: . collide_with(x::Asteroid, y::Asteroid) = ... # deal with asteroid hitting asteroid collide_with(x::Asteroid, y::Spaceship) = ... # deal with asteroid hitting spaceship collide_with(x::Spaceship, y::Asteroid) = ... # deal with spaceship hitting asteroid collide_with(x::Spaceship, y::Spaceship) = ... # deal with spaceship hitting spaceship . Type dispatch can be especially useful in data science, where you might allow different input types (i.e. Numpy arrays and Pandas dataframes) to a function that processes data. Type dispatch allows you to have a common API for functions that do similar tasks. . Unfortunately, Python does not support this out-of-the box. Fortunately, there is the @typedispatch decorator to the rescue. This decorator relies upon type hints in order to route inputs the correct version of the function: . @typedispatch def f(x:str, y:str): return f&#39;{x}{y}&#39; @typedispatch def f(x:np.ndarray): return x.sum() @typedispatch def f(x:int, y:int): return x+y . Below is a demonstration of type dispatch at work for the function f: . f(&#39;Hello &#39;, &#39;World!&#39;) . &#39;Hello World!&#39; . f(2,3) . 5 . f(np.array([5,5,5,5])) . 20 . There are limitations of this feature, as well as other ways of using this functionality that you can read about here. In the process of learning about typed dispatch, I also found a python library called multipledispatch made my Mathhew Rocklin (the creator of Dask). . After using this feature, I am now motivated to learn languages like Julia to discover what other paradigms I might be missing. . . A better version of functools.partial . functools.partial is a great utility that creates functions from other functions that lets you set default values. Lets take this function for example that filters a list to only contain values &gt;= val: . test_input = [1,2,3,4,5,6] def f(arr, val): &quot;Filter a list to remove any values that are less than val.&quot; return [x for x in arr if x &gt;= val] f(test_input, 3) . [3, 4, 5, 6] . You can create a new function out of this function using partial that sets the default value to 5: . filter5 = partial(f, val=5) filter5(test_input) . [5, 6] . One problem with partial is that it removes the original docstring and replaces it with a generic docstring: . filter5.__doc__ . &#39;partial(func, *args, **keywords) - new function with partial application n of the given arguments and keywords. n&#39; . fastcore.utils.partialler fixes this, and makes sure the docstring is retained such that the new API is transparent: . filter5 = partialler(f, val=5) filter5.__doc__ . &#39;Filter a list to remove any values that are less than val.&#39; . . Composition of functions . A technique that is pervasive in functional programming languages is function composition, whereby you chain a bunch of functions together to achieve some kind of result. This is especially useful when applying various data transformations. Consider a toy example where I have three functions: (1) Removes elements of a list less than 5 (from the prior section) (2) adds 2 to each number (3) sums all the numbers: . def add(arr, val): return [x + val for x in arr] def arrsum(arr): return sum(arr) # See the previous section on partialler add2 = partialler(add, val=2) transform = compose(filter5, add2, arrsum) transform([1,2,3,4,5,6]) . 15 . But why is this useful? You might me thinking, I can accomplish the same thing with: . arrsum(add2(filter5([1,2,3,4,5,6]))) . You are not wrong! However, composition gives you a convenient interface in case you want to do something like the following: . def fit(x, transforms:list): &quot;fit a model after performing transformations&quot; x = compose(*transforms)(x) y = [np.mean(x)] * len(x) # its a dumb model. Don&#39;t judge me return y # filters out elements &lt; 5, adds 2, then predicts the mean fit(x=[1,2,3,4,5,6], transforms=[filter5, add2]) . [7.5, 7.5] . For more information about compose, read the docs. . . A more useful __repr__ . In python, __repr__ helps you get information about an object for logging and debugging. Below is what you get by default when you define a new class. (Note: we are using store_attr, which was discussed earlier). . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b=2, c=3): store_attr() # `store_attr` was discussed previously Test(1) . &lt;__main__.Test at 0x7ff9e95a5730&gt; . We can use basic_repr to quickly give us a more sensible default: . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b=2, c=3): store_attr() __repr__ = basic_repr(&#39;a,b,c&#39;) Test(2) . Test(a=2, b=2, c=3) . . Monkey Patching With A Decorator . It can be convenient to monkey patch with a decorator, which is especially helpful when you want to patch an external library you are importing. We can use the decorator @patch from fastcore.foundation along with type hints like so: . class MyClass(int): pass @patch def func(self:MyClass, a): return self+a mc = MyClass(3) . Now, MyClass has an additional method named func: . mc.func(10) . 13 . Still not convinced? I&#39;ll show you another example of this kind of patching in the next section. . . A better pathlib.Path . When you see these extensions to pathlib.path you won&#39;t ever use vanilla pathlib again! A number of additional methods have been added to pathlib, such as: . Path.readlines: same as with open(&#39;somefile&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f: f.readlines() | Path.read: same as with open(&#39;somefile&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f: f.read() | Path.save: saves file as pickle | Path.load: loads pickle file | Path.ls: shows the contents of the path as a list. | etc. | . Read more about this here. Here is a demonstration of ls: . from pathlib import Path p = Path(&#39;../_notebooks&#39;) p.ls() # you don&#39;t get this with vanilla Pathlib.Path!! . (#21) [Path(&#39;../_notebooks/gpt2_simple_mask.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/bert_mac_small.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/causal_with_prefix.jpg&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/.DS_Store&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/2020-03-07-How_to_Create_an_Automatic_Code_Comment_Generator_using_Deep_Learning.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/2020-09-01-fastcore.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/2020-03-07-Syntax-Highlighting.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/2020-03-06-bart.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/README.md&#39;),Path(&#39;../_notebooks/2020-05-01-TrainDonkeyCar.ipynb&#39;)...] . Wait! What&#39;s going on here? We just imported pathlib.Path - why are we getting this new functionality? Thats because we imported the fastcore.foundation module, which patches this module via the @patch decorator discussed earlier. Just to drive the point home on why the @patch decorator is useful, I&#39;ll go ahead and add another method to Path right now: . @patch def fun(self:Path): return &quot;This is fun!&quot; p.fun() . &#39;This is fun!&#39; . That is magical, right? I know! That&#39;s why I&#39;m writing about it! . . An Even More Concise Way To Create Lambdas . Self, with an uppercase S, is an even more concise way to create lambdas that are calling methods on an object. For example, let&#39;s create a lambda for taking the sum of a Numpy array: . arr=np.array([5,4,3,2,1]) f = lambda a: a.sum() assert f(arr) == 15 . You can use Self in the same way: . f = Self.sum() assert f(arr) == 15 . Let&#39;s create a lambda that does a groupby and max of a Pandas dataframe: . import pandas as pd df=pd.DataFrame({&#39;Some Column&#39;: [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, ], &#39;Another Column&#39;: [5, 7, 50, 70]}) f = Self.groupby(&#39;Some Column&#39;).mean() f(df) . Another Column . Some Column . a 6 | . b 60 | . Read more about Self in the docs). . . Notebook Functions . These are simple but handy, and allow you to know whether or not code is executing in a Jupyter Notebook, Colab, or an Ipython Shell: . in_notebook(), in_colab(), in_ipython() . (True, False, True) . This is useful if you are displaying certain types of visualizations, progress bars or animations in your code that you may want to modify or toggle depending on the environment. . . A Drop-In Replacement For List . You might be pretty happy with Python&#39;s list. This is one of those situations that you don&#39;t know you needed a better list until someone showed one to you. Enter L, a list like object with many extra goodies. . The best way I can describe L is to pretend that list and numpy had a pretty baby: . define a list (check out the nice __repr__ that shows the length of the list!) . L(1,2,3) . (#3) [1,2,3] . Shuffle a list: . p = L.range(20).shuffle() p . (#20) [16,2,9,11,3,6,10,7,19,4...] . Index into a list: . p[2,4,6] . (#3) [9,3,10] . L has sensible defaults, for example appending an element to a list: . 1 + L(2,3,4) . (#4) [1,2,3,4] . There is much more L has to offer. Read the docs to learn more. . But Wait ... There&#39;s More! . There are more things I would like to show you about fastcore, but there is no way they would reasonably fit into a blog post. Here is a list of some of my favorite things that I didn&#39;t demo in this blog post: . Utilities . The Utilites section contain many shortcuts to perform common tasks or provide an additional interface to what standard python provides. . mk_class: quickly add a bunch of attributes to a class | wrap_class: add new methods to a class with a simple decorator | groupby: similar to Scala&#39;s groupby | merge: merge dicts | fasttuple: a tuple on steroids | Infinite Lists: useful for padding and testing | chunked: for batching and organizing stuff | . Multiprocessing . The Multiprocessing section extends python&#39;s multiprocessing library by offering features like: . progress bars | ability to pause to mitigate race conditions with external services | processing things in batches on each worker, ex: if you have a vectorized operation to perform in chunks | . Functional Programming . The functional programming section is my favorite part of this library. . maps: a map that also composes functions | mapped: A more robust map | using_attr: compose a function that operates on an attribute | . Transforms . Transforms is a collection of utilities for creating data transformations and associated pipelines. These transformation utilities build upon many of the building blocks discussed in this blog post. . Further Reading . It should be noted that you should read the main page of the docs first, followed by the section on tests to fully understand the documentation. . The fastcore documentation site. | The fastcore GitHub repo. | Blog post on delegation. | . Shameless plug: fastpages . This blog post was written entirely in a Jupyter Notebook, which GitHub automatically converted into to a blog post! Sound interesting? Check out fastpages. .",

            "content": "This is a short post with a few Conda commands and notes. I am adding my most frequently using commands. Use carefully, YMMV. I am sourcing these from the Conda Docs1. It is mainly intended as a quick reference for myself. . Basics and Introduction: . Conda is a package and environment manager primarily for Python. For our current context, it helps in installing packages while resolving their dependencies. Conda also helps in creating environments which I think of as isolated boxes with their own set of versions of packages (and even python). . We can switch across environments without worrying if installing a new package will create conflicts. For eg, a new package C might need version x.x of package B while an already existing package A needs version x.y. Without environments, this could lead to dependency issues. . This environment information is also useful when we share our issues/packages etc where we can specify exactly which version of each package is required to either reproduce our problem or to install and work properly on our package. . Conda requires an Anaconda (or Miniconda) installation. Once it is installed on Windows, all the conda commands are accessible from the Anaconda Prompt which can be invoked from the Start Menu. . To verify that conda is available, check: . conda --version . To update to lastest version of conda: . conda update conda . Most used commands . To create a new environment: . conda create --name myenv . This creates an environment with the same python version as the Anaconda installation. To create an environment with a different version of python (say 3.5): . conda create --name myenv python=3.5 . These create environments with a default set of packages. To create an environment of python 3.5 and installing a particular package of required version: . conda create --name myenv package_name=version python=3.5 . It is recommended to install all the packages required in an environment in one go. To activate the created environment: . conda activate myenv . To go back to base environment: . conda activate . To install a package using conda: . Search for the package . conda search package_name . | Install the package . conda install package_name . | Verify it is installed . conda list . | We can also use pip along with conda. To use pip in the environment, first install pip: . conda install -n myenv pip . Conda and pip can have conflicts. So install as much as possible using conda. Other recommendations can be seen from here . To remove an environment: . conda remove --name myenv --all . These are the basic commands that I think should be most useful. If I find more commands, I will update this post. . ‘Til Later . References: . Conda Docs | Tim Hopper’s Blog |",

The latest rage in these circles, at least according to Medium, is Journaling. . There are several nice articles about Journaling and its benefits, especially from James Clear and Ben Hardy. There is an overload of information about it. Seriously! Anyway these two are my favourites. Since I like to imagine myself writing, journaling is tempting. Unlike other self-improvement activities, it is taxing only the brain. I think I will have a go at it. I don’t feel comfortable writing in a notebook, nor am I comfortable putting it on the servers of a random dotcom. So I think I will write my thoughts in plaintext in Emacs. Not very secure, I know, so I will find a way that it is backed up securely. I plan to devote half an hour every day before sleeping. I will keep the timing flexible as I usually end up quitting when I miss out on a day or two. I haven’t decided what is to be my aim for journaling, so I will do some more research and keep that flexible till then. Lets see how all this goes. Becoming a 10X person is certainly the goal ;). . I am undecided on what to write next. I will update this soon. . ‘Til Later .",

            "content": "As the tin says, this is about my interest in music. It is vaguely interesting that in more than 10 years of infrequent blogging, I have very rarely mentioned this topic. . I can’t even point to a point where I became interested in music. My family has its fair share of decent musicians though only a few are really good at it. But most of us can carry a tune. . I grew up listening to cassette tapes and All India Radio and Chitrahaar. I think I must have heard Venkateshwara Suprabhatam and Mahishasura Marddini Sthothram pretty much every day till I was 18 or so, rather frequently even later. All those songs, devotional or not are interwoven tightly in the fairly idyllic tapestry of my pre-adulthood life. . When I moved to Calicut for college, a Philips MP3 player was amongst my most prized possessions! I carried with me all those songs from my childhood. I had also somehow acquired a taste for Malayalam songs and Carnatic music. Both my best friends were music aficionados, one a long-time practitioner as well! It was great fun. I was properly introduced to Western music at this juncture. Till then, my knowledge extended to the drumming chorus of “We will rock you” and Blues. I had of course heard my fair share of Mozart but Metallica or Guns’n’Roses were all new to me. Sampling an entirely new course of music was fun. . One difference I noticed is the differential role of instruments between Indian and Western music. In Indian music, instruments are background. Barring a few famous practitioners, instrumentalists are the seasoning than the main course. Songs also have instruments as transitional elements or garnishing than in its own right. I am limited by my listening comprehension but I also feel the lyrics being prominent in Indian music. . You might be wondering where I am going with this. Coming to the point, one of my motivations for learning ML/DL was in its application to music. I want study the above hypotheses. I also want to learn how to classify music to raagas. All these are areas I will focus attention on once I have a firm grasp on the topics involved. Concluding my rambling post on that note. .

No, this is not a statement of purpose begging some university to give me admission because look I always loved electronics. . It has been always more of a windowshopping type of love because goddamn they are expensive! Still, I have owned two laptops, two kindles, one desktop, multiple phones (one iOS, three Android and three feature phones), two music players (one iPod and one mp3 player) and wow that is a lot considering I am yet to hit my 30th birthday and that all of this was collected after my 18th birthday. Dare I say this is still lower than most people I know. . Still there is a lot of stuff I have missed out on that most white people I know seem to have owned, notably a gaming console and an iPad. I am not a big fan of gaming consoles as I find the handheld controller fairly clunky as compared to the mouse and keyboard combination. The iPad is definitely on my list though! I am especially a big fan of the Pencil. Similarly another thing that makes me interested is the Remarkable Tablet.

            "content": "As I mentioned in an earlier post, this humble blogger got married last year. Miscellaneous house visits later, we went on our honeymoon to Bhutan, the Land of the Thunder Dragon. Absolutely fantastic place with fantastic people and superb sights1. This post is a tiny window (strictly G-rated) into our trip - the trek2 to the Taktsang Monastery in Paro. . While hashing out an itinerary, Taktsang or Tiger’s Nest as it is referred to in English was a tiny debating point. On the one hand it is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in Bhutan. On the other hand, a trek isn’t usually part of a honeymoon. We finally ended up deciding that it was too important a place to skip just for convention’s sake. That proved to be a good decision as despite the difficulties, it proved more than equal to its reputation. . There were three main cities that were part of our itinerary and Paro was the last point in our sojourn in Bhutan. It was also the most beatiful place we saw. It is amazing how much Paro looks like something out of a postcard. Lush green paddy fields, tiny town centre with beatiful buildings, a majestic fort that is lit up at night and even a tiny river! . We reached Paro from Thimphu after a tiny detour to see the famous Dochula Pass the evening of the day before the one we had dedicated for the Taktsang trek. A late lunch and a mild yet superfun white water raft session later, we went to our hotel. As it was a fair distance from Paro proper, our driver came to pick us up for dinner and also some late night touristy stuff such as pics of the aforementioned lit up fort. We then settled down back at our hotel in anticipation of next day’s trek. . (Complimentary) breakfast later, we were on our way. The Taktsang monastery is set on the cliffside and it looks impossibly high up. Our guide repeatedly advised us to not focus on how far away it looks and instead just walk as if we were out on a stroll. There is a flat fee of 500 Nu (1 Nu = 1 INR) per person for the trek paid at the base itself. Walking sticks in hand and caps to protect against the sun, we started the trek. . The trek is around 5 km to the top and is fairly easy with a few difficult sections for the beginner. There is a cafeteria midway and the second half is pretty easy except for a big set of staircases! But that is jumping ahead in the story. We went at a good pace for the first hour or so but then the OH who was on her first trek started huffing and puffing. The elevation is not that much to worry about oxygen et al but the terrain is fairly uneven. Our guide was fantastic at motivating and with lots of stories about the monastery as well as Buddhism in Bhutan we reached the midway point, the cafetaria. We rested for some time, had some coloured sugared carbonated water (Fanta ;)) and resumed the trek. We took the steeper but scenic route and soon the cliff wall that hosted the monastery was in our view. . Obligatory pics taken, we continued and soon hit the most anxiety-inducing part of the entire trek for me - a massive (700 steps) set of staircase! The number itself was massive but the worst part was that it included a downhill and uphill stretch. So there was no luxury of only climbing in one direction T.T. We persevered (especially after seeing people twice or more our age doing the same) and reached the monastery. Keeping all our stuff in a locker room, we went through all the temples that are part of the monastery. . As a background, the monastery is dedicated to Padmasambhava or Guru Rinpoche, the enlightened master who brought Buddhism to Bhutan. He is said to have flown in from Tibet on a tiger and meditated at this spot for three years, three months, three weeks, three days and three hours. The mythos surrounding him and Taktsang are interesting and worth reading about. He is said to have meditated in a cave shaped like a triangular dagger. An interesting thing we saw was that the prasadam (religious offerings) are a type of conical cake and then whatever food that the devotees carry as offering. So we got Hide &amp; Seek, fryums etc as prasadam, a welcome relief! . We spent around an hour in the temple complex. By the time we went through all these temples, each involving a small set of stairs, our feet were a fine mess and each step felt like an ordeal. We then started back and after navigating THE STAIRS one more time, we were on the downward stretch. . We again made towards the cafeteria and had a very late lunch. A word of advice, it is very expensive and better avoided. After lunch, we then hurried back as there were portents of rain and we didn’t want to be stuck (or sliding) on the gravelly and slippery path. After what it felt like ages, we reached downhill and could say we completed the Paro Taktsang Trek. . Closing time curio shoppping later, we were off to our hotel. We didn’t even wait to have a proper dinner and just collapsed on our bed. Phew that was such a relief. We returned the next day to Phuentsholing and then back home the day after but that is not a subject of this post. . Tomorrow I will write about my love affair with gadgets. . ‘Til Later . 1Shoutout to our organisers BHUTAN BEST INBOUND NB: this is is not a paid advertisement, just an endorsement of good people . 2Do not be misled into thinking we are regular trekkers, this is just the third within the last year .",

            "content": "I am no movie buff. Give me a handful of my favourite ones and I can spend the rest of my life rewatching them. I still end up going to more movies than I expect. . Luca was one such movie. Till about half an hour before the show, I was under the impression that we were going to watch Article 15. I was not enthusiastic about either. The former because I didn’t know such a movie existed, the latter because of the rather predictable “upper caste saviour” lens. Anyway I went for Luca knowing only that it has Tovino and Ahaana as the leads. . The rest of might be spoiler-y (duh! what do you expect from a review) so beware if you are against that sort of thing. It is also a fairly irreverent review. . It has two storylines, one being the investigation of the death of a semi-famous artist due to unknown causes, the other being the description of the events that lead to the aforementioned artist’s death. . The investigation is from the point of view of a random cop who is in the final stages of a fairly amicable divorce where both parties appear to be self-sacrificing. The other storyline is in the form of the cop reading a diary sent to Luca from Nihaarika. . The movie begins with the police starting the investigation. The main cop stumbles upon a diary and he takes it back to his home where he sleeps in a separate floor with a cat (belonging to past love who left him heartbroken). He reads the diary to sleep every night and we learn the story of Luca and Nihaarika. . We learn that Luca is an eccentric artist with a social conscience but a short fuse (cliche alert). He is also an orphan with both parents passing away in a troubled manner leaving him with acute fear of death and the dead. Nihaarika is an industrial chemistry PhD student (foreshadow klaxon) who has come to Kochi to stay with her uncle. She also has a troubled past. . They meet at an art exhibition where they have a heated argument because Niha (as her loved ones call her) mocks an artwork designed by Luca that looks like hung garbage from where they were standing (hint it needed to be seen from a different PoV). They make up after she apologises and become friendly over a coffee. . During a spontaneous painting session, we learn that her uncle molested her and she justifiably carries that fear and resentment as she was made to promise never to reveal it to her mother by him. She moves in with him to get away from her uncle. Soon there are meetings with friends and guardians and mentors and they have a jolly good time while slowly falling in love with each other (in a month). There are lighthearted arguments about his habit of sticking pencils in his ear and flipping pages with a licked finger (foreshadow klaxon). . As the story progresses, we have the inevitable scene where a drunk Luca confronts the evil uncle and soon confesses his love for her. Later they are protesting a colony of poor people geting eviction orders from a rich construction company. When it proves ineffective, they decide to paint the walls of the propery with the faces of those poor people getting evicted. But tragedy strikes and while they are running away from cops who spot them at the scene he blacks out. They learn that he has the same terminal brain condition his mother passed away from and he has only a few months left. He predictably pushes her away and she ends up going to Bangalore to her mother. . In the main storyline, the investigation meanders along until suspicions of foul play start when they learn that Nihaarika also died a week before Luca and both died from the same poison. Then suspects are paraded and it switches attention from a friend of Luca to the evil uncle to the rich construction company and so on. If you read till now you have a fair idea of what happened. Turns out the clever chemist created a painless poison as a means of helping her thanatophobic lover have a painless death. It is applied on the pages of the diary she sent and he consumes it every time he flips a page. This is discovered when the cop’s cat also dies after licking those pages and the estranged wife suggests scanning the book. They get back together in this morbid fashion and the movie ends. . One line review . A below average movie that could have been average but didn’t due to multple reasons. . Not a one line review . There was a hint of a promise and the movie is not as bad as I make it seem. . The Good . The story is above average despite my mocking. The foreshadowing was rather heavyhanded but it was still an interesting twist. Tovino had a decent outing and looked fire. Ahaana also looked the part. A few characters where good, shoutout to the assistant cop who did what we all wanted to do and slapped the shit out of the evil uncle. . The Bad . The dialogues were meh and the storyline of the cop should have been edited much more. There were loads of superfluous scenes especially multiple long sequences where this guy gets out from his car in torrential rain and goes to his upstairs room while his wife peeks from the window. Bleh. All their interactions were so wooden. That entire storyline needed a drastic cropping. A 1.5 hour movie dragged into a 2.5 hour one. There are many cliches and the intended red herrings were very clunky. I also feel that the ethics of euthanasia was not handled well. . The Ugly . The acting was really bad. Phew. . Overall I rate it is a 2/5 or a 5.5/10 movie. It could have been a 3/5 or a 6.5/10 movie. . ~At the moment, I am struggling a bit on what I should write next, so I will update this post soon.~ I decided to write about a place we visited in Bhutan. . ‘Til Later .",

            "title": "Handi Gundi Betta",
            "content": "As promised yesterday, here is a short post about our trek at Handi Gundi Betta in Ramanagara. . Planning for this trek happened fairly early through a WhatsApp group but it came to my realisation only a day or two before it. Our travel to Kerala for the weekend got cancelled due to the vagaries of the Tatkal allotment process. Since we were stuck were anyway, I thought why not walk a few kilometers uphill to compensate for the sheer laziness I was going to indulge in for the rest of the weekend. The OH decided to start indulging earlier so it was just me with the rest of the gang. . This trek was intended to be an “Intro to Trekking” for the youngest of us all (the awesome planners from my Dudhsagar blog procreated) and the now 5 year old was to be indoctrinated into the cult with this trek. There were descriptions floating about it as being a Lazy Man’s Trek so it was to be the perfect gateway. . Going back to the story, I reached their place the night before as we were planning to leave by 6:30 in the morning. Handi Gundi Betta is around 80 km away (or as we Bangaloreans say, anything between 1.5 hours to few days away) on Mysore Road. It is not that far from the famous Rasta Cafe. We were hoping to start trekking before the sun makes too much of a mess. The 8 of us (including aforementioned 5 year old) reached the tiny tiny tiny village at the base after following some spookily clear instructions on a blog (there were suspicions of a time-travelling Rohilettan being the author). We made a pitstop for light breakfast and started the hike from the parked cars by 830 or so. . Instructions after the parking spot were not clear and when we hit two roads diverged in a yellow hill, we took the path more travelled by and that made all the difference (ha!)1. It was a winding track that ended up at the base of the hill and we started climbing. It didn’t appear to be a lazy man’s trek as there were fairly challenging stretches for a beginner (pretty much all of us involved). I was starting to wonder if the Overton Window (or the equivalent) for laziness has shifted so far towards activity. It was still not that bad and we toiled on and reached the top in around 2 hours with only a few breaks. . The view there was as fantastic as anticipated and as it was fairly overcast, with the wind it was splendid at the top. Given the chance, I would have gladly slept the entire day there. We had the packed brunch of toast (cheese and otherwise) and eggs and spent some time just chatting. It has to be noted that we were completely alone and didn’t see even a single person anywhere. . After a few rounds of photos and panoramas (the usual touristy stuff), we started back. I usually find the descent harder than the climb as it feels like too much stress on the legs (after the Vaishno Devi trip, my legs were randomly twitching for a few days). We were almost 3/4th of the way down when this guy suddenly popped up and asked wtf we were doing in Protected Forest Area. Ouch. Thankfully one of us could speak Kannada fluently so we were able to get out with a warning to not repeat. The guy looked pretty sketchy and we were wondering if he was out for a quick buck. . Apparently the trek and the area itself is restricted access with permission only. He told us that there is a board and everything and we were confused as we didn’t see anything of that sort. Turns out we took a completely wrong route and the start point was at a different side of the hill itself. We went down along the route he indicated and sure enough there was a board although it was completely in Kannada. It would have been much better and dare I say more effective if the board was situated better instead of right at the base of the hill (the spot where we parked cars would have been a more sensible choice). We then had to backtrack a little because the route to the car was through a different way. We finally reached back at the car and started back to boring old Bangalore. We had a very late lunch and a round of confused Mafia. I then hightailed back home as it was already very late and my dear OH must have been sneham vidarthinikkal at the poomukhavathilkkal for a long time. . It was a bit lucky that we took the wrong turn as we would not have done the trek (none of us would break the law just for a joy). Though the primary motive was not achieved (5 y.o. just wanted to be back at the car), it was a good day out with the gang. The trek was fun and a good workout and the food was superb. Shoutout to everyone involved for the great day. I will update this later with a few pics. . Tomorrow I will write a review about Luca, a Malayalam movie released recently that we saw last week. . ‘Til Later . 1I am inordinately proud of this reference :D .",

I made an attempt at this last summer but ended up not doing anything. I want to do better (not that hard to be fair!).

Do check out fast.ai for more details about the course including materials covered and the teaching philosophy itself. . Though I made the pledge last month and did make several inroads, it hasn’t been consistent. So I am restarting it starting tomorrow. There are 14 lessons and about 30 hours of videos. I am planning to complete two lectures a week starting tomorrow. So I hope to complete the lessons within ~1.5 months. When I say complete two lectures a week, I mean I will be watching the lectures and making notes, then going through the lesson materials and (Jupyter) notebooks.

            "content": "We (read: Yours Truly, The Wife, The Sister, The Parents and The Wife’s Brother) went on a pilgrimage this month. As the title suggests, it was to Vaishno Devi. . For the uninitiated, Vaishno Devi is a temple in Jammu. It is an important temple for North Indians. It is the first place visited by a newly-wed couple, even before their honeymoon. It features three natural stone statues within a cave depicting three Devis (goddesses). People had to crawl through the cave to reach the statues. But that way has been closed and devotees use artificial tunnels now. . The journey to the temple starts at the basecamp town of Katra which is around 40km from Jammu proper. The temple is ~12-13km hike uphill from Katra. Earlier, everyone had to go to Jammu (rail/road/air) and take transportation to Katra from there. The rail network was recently extended and now there are trains to Katra. . The paved roads were already very good at least 20 years back (first time we went) and it has only improved since then. There are restrooms and refreshments sprinkled throughout the route. A highlight are the water fountains with ice cold spring water. A majority of restrooms are in very good condition now (they were very bad earlier). . The hike can be rather strenuous if you are not used to intense activity. There are several sections which have steep inclines. If you want “Darshan” but are unable/unwilling to navigate the climb, you have several options. There are ponies and palanquins from the startpoint itself. There are electric cars from the midway point as well. These alternates increase the difficulty of the journey for the hiking demographic. . Planning started early as The Parents are prone to do. The temple is crowded most of the time with queues of 4-5 hours at the top considered normal. We chose the time right before Chaitra Navaratri as it is less crowded. The Plan extended to include Jwalamukhi as well as three associated temples. . The Parents and The Sister started their journey from Madurai and the rest of us from Bangalore. The three of us reached Delhi on Saturday, 30th March and slept over at the wife’s aunt’s place. On Sunday morning after a delicious breakfast, we visited the famous Akshardham temple. I have been there before but it was the first time for the wife and her brother. It was an enjoyable visit despite the intense heat. (Delhi got over its winter a week before we reached. There were blankets visible in most of the houses we went to!) . The rest came via Chennai and reached on Sunday afternoon. We met up at my friend’s place and dumped half our luggage there as half of our trip was to be in Delhi. Then we went to the railway station (code: NDLS) and boarded the Shri Shakti Express (code: 22461) to Katra (code: SVDK). I had a mild headache so I parked myself in the top berth and slept till after dinner. The rest reportedly had an enjoyable dinner of chholey kulcha (the traitors). I sated my hunger with curd. . We reached very early and then went on to the IRCTC guesthouse in the station itself. We had booked a room for freshening up and lockers for keeping the rest of our luggage. It was very good and neat. The breakfast was also very good. . After breakfast, wearing matching clothes we started our hike from Katra at around 8:30 AM. We carried only our coats as once you start climbing each gram starts weighing like a kilo. (Ounce and pound for the people without standards). There is the option of porter for carrying your luggage too. The guesthouse has a pickup and drop facility to the startpoint of the hike (called Banganga). We utilized it and went to the checkpoint where we have to collect a token. This token marks your position in the queue once you are at the top. Alternatively military personnel get passes which provides entry to a separate queue. That queue joins the general queue a bit further ahead. Through some contacts we snagged one such and collected ours. . Equipped with walking sticks and lots of enthusiasm we started walking. We pumped ourselves with various liquids whenever there were omens of tiredness. Our primary fuel was the superb sugarcane juice. Sugarcane juice felt tastier as compared to the ones we get in Bangalore. It might have been expectations and preconceptions though (mountains and freshness yadda yadda). . The hike was still exhausting. A caution to the unfit first-timers, the stairs look very tempting, do not attempt those. It is very very difficult. Instead, walk at an easy pace and rest when tired. . Katra to Adhkuwari (the midway point) was the difficult stretch. We learned later that a new (a bit longer) route has been opened with a more forgiving incline. Adhkuwari, has another cave temple. It doesn’t have any artificial cave as at the top. As a result it is very difficult as at many points you have to crawl, and at the end someone has to drag you up the cave. People go through in batches of 150 or so. . We have not been fortunate to go through this cave in all the times we have been to Vaishno Devi. This place has another token system like at the top. We didn’t take a token while climbing up as we were unsure if our turn be over by the time we return. We had booked a dormitory for the return stretch, planning to stay overnight and wait for our turn. . We now started on the home stretch. There is a new-ish route from Adhkuwari to the Bhavan (the main temple), which makes this very easy. Barring occasional steep sections, it is a very gentle slope. We covered that part (again around 6km) quickly and were at the Bhavan around 12:30 PM or so. From our experience, it is better to start as early as possible as it can get very warm while climbing. I would recommend to start latest by 7 AM and the hike would be easier. . At the Bhavan, we kept all our stuff in a locker. Mobile phones/belts/bags etc, the usual stuff are not allowed in the temple. We went and finished the Darshan very quickly due to the low crowd. The military pass further reduced the time. The Darshan went very well. As (honorary for her ;)) Delhiites, it was another milestone. We were all happy and tired. . By this time we were very hungry, except my sister who was feeling very faint and refused to have food. We force-fed her some sugar water, colloquially known as Coca Cola, while we had our lunch at a Sagar Ratna hotel. The food was superb, especially due to how hungry we were. After a yummy meal of Rajma Chawal, we started the next phase - Bhairav Temple. . Bhairav is the demon slayed by Vaishno Devi. There is a temple dedicated to the demon in the place where his head fell. A hero conquering an enemy and then the enemy becoming a protective deity is interesting. There was something similar in the Taktsang monastery in Paro. (We visited Bhutan for our honeymoon!) . This temple is around 3km uphill from the Bhavan. The route to Bhairav is tough and it takes almost 2 hours to cover this distance. But recently a ropeway was opened. At Rs 100 per person, we could cover the 3 hour up-down journey in an hour. The ropeway time is around a minute, the rest is waiting in the queue. . We were back at the Bhavan by 4 PM or so. After collecting our stuff from the locker, started the downhill hike to Adhkuwari. . The downhill hike presents a completely different challenge. You have to keep a control on the speed you are walking, lest you slip/fall. That leads to further strain on the knees and legs. We were all aching in different parts of the body by then. My mom was walking with a sling as her hand had started swelling and aching from no discernible cause. . We reached Adhkuwari around 6 PM and took a token for the Adhkuwari temple. Then we checked in to our dormitories. The facilities are very simple but neat and clean. On enquiry, the current group waiting for entry had coupon number 330 while ours was 551. Things looked very pessimistic. We gathered blankets for everyone and settled down for the night. (Security deposit of Rs 500 per blanket.) . My wife and I went out to get food for everyone. We shared some aaloo/paneer parantha. I got chowmein and fried rice for my sister and her brother respectively (both are addicts to those!). My dad was feeling feverish so he didn’t want anything. My mom shared the chowmein. Tired and sleepy, we settled down for the night. . Waking up, we saw to our disappointment that the ongoing group number was still around 400. There was a teensy little relief as well. (Crawling through a cave is exciting before a 20km trek, intimidating after!) . It would take most of the day for our group’s turn so we abandoned that plan and started the downhill trek to Katra. We navigated most of the downhill trek through the stairs. We reached the bottom a refueling stop and a pretty twisty wirey hanging stop later. . We made our way to the local general hospital as my mom’s hand was now aching a lot. An X-ray and consultation later (it was diagnosed not serious), we made our way back to the IRCTC guesthouse. . There was a mixup as our reservation expired half an hour before we reached. We didn’t realise and were on our way to the dormitory beds we thought were in our name. They were rude to us though, as if we were cheats. It felt bad, as it could have been resolved without all the drama. That was a black mark on the otherwise excellent guesthouse. We rebooked a few beds and then rested till our next train. . The next phase of our journey started at 2:35 PM on the Jammu Mail (code: 14034) to Pathankot Cantonment (code: PTKC). Pathankot Cantonment as that was the station enroute to Jwalamukhi, our next destination. We had booked a taxi from Pathankot that would take us there as well as 3 associated temples. That is a different blogpost though. . ‘Til Later .",

Especially for someone like me who might well have been the muse for Newton’s 1st Law. My favourite suggestion so far regarding building habits has been about how it is best to add small steps to your pre-existing routine and add triggers for the habit you want to form. For eg, after an existing habit like brushing after waking up, drink a glass of water. Gradually drinking that glass of water would be part of your routine. It is all about incremental progress - 1% improvement every day is 37 times improvement over a year. Compounding is magic. . I am trying to add a few habits (never do more than say 3 or so).

When building a value with o+, always use 0 for the value of the terminating line, for adding 0 does not change the value of an addition. | When building a value with x, always use 1 for the value of the terminating line, for multiplying by 1 does not change the value of a multiplication. | When building a value with cons, always consider () for the value of the terminating line. | .

The rest was fairly simple. As an interesting sidenote, while looking at a code example in Javascript, I could connect that to the commandments in Scheme which felt very nice. . Chapter 4 is about numerical operations on atoms as well extending it to S-expressions. We also start refining the commandments. The simplest example of operations on numbers is incrementing a number by 1: . (define add1 (lambda (n) (+ n 1))) . We create all mathematical operations using add1 and sub1. . Chapter 5 is all about *s. We continue refining the original commandments as well as to redefine many of the original functions to operate on all instances instead of the first instance. For example, rember is a function that removes the first instance of an atom passed as argument from a list: . (define rember (lambda (a lat) (cond ((null? lat) &#39;()) ((eq? (car lat) a) (cdr lat)) (else (cons (car lat) (rember a (cdr lat))))))) . To extend this to rember* for removing all instances of the atom passed as argument from a list: . (define atom? (lambda (x) (and (not (pair? x)) (not (null? x))))) (define rember* (lambda (a l) (cond ((null? a) &#39;()) ((atom? (car l)) (cond ((eq? a (car l)) (rember* (cdr l))) (else (cons (car l) (rember* (cdr l)))))) (else (cons (rember* (a (car l)) (rember* a (cdr l)))))))) .

            "content": "So my blog has moved hosting places again. . Well not quite. To be precise, the movement was from the previous post onwards. So I thought I will write something about it. It has been a long (this June marks 10 years of blogging!) and choppy journey. Each phase feels like it is a good reflection of a phase of my life. . From a global perspective, I started blogging fairly late but within my peer group, I was one of the early adopters and among the few who had a fairly well maintained one. . 2009-2011 . I started blogging at Blogger at the very imaginative url: istheurlavailable.blogspot.com. The initial names were incredibly corny. . It started while I was still in my teens (19 going on 20). It lasted for 2 eventful years of my college. I like to think I blogged fairly often but there are big timegaps with little to no content. The content over there has me cringing to be honest. . I was awkward and bumbling and thought too highly of myself. I used to think complicated words maketh the man and filled my blog with 4 or 5 syllable words (the blog title had raconteur cringe in it for a not so insignificant timeframe!) that are better suited in a GRE word list. I still like the rhymes over there though. . I was fairly disdainful of Twitter which is surprising when I look back now. I used to like Harry Potter! I transitioned from a passive observer/fan of Liverpool Football Club to a much more (obsessively) active one. I was still fairly optimistic towards life. . The last paragraph might or might not have independent statements. . My last post there was about losing my hair. Pretty fitting. . 2011-2017 . Then I moved to Wordpress at the very imaginative url: istheurlavailable.wordpress.com. I managed to carry over my posts from Blogger to Wordpress but there were issues in formatting and I was too lazy to fix it. Wordpress was the second phase. It is a bit crazy to think how long it lasted. It starts in Bangalore and covers nearly 6 years of my life! . There are 2 years at Bangalore (work), 3 years in Indiana (grad school+work) and a year back in Bangalore. Let me give them the separate sections they deserve. . 2011-2013 Bangalore . I continued from my previous phase still awkward and bumbling but no longer thinking too highly of myself. I still liked big words but I daresay I no longer attached that much value to knowing random words. . Bangalore was a fun phase of my life. There were worrisome times but I was earning money and living with friends and traveling and enjoying life. . 2013-2016 Indiana . Indiana me starts awkward and bumbling and very optimistic and excited about life and ends up awkward and bumbling and depressed and apathetic (the date is a bit misleading, it was in my drafts for more than a year!) about pretty much everything. There are good parts in between but it is fairly bad and I hope to eventually get over it. It is a work in progress. . Incidentally I was reading a section from Daniel Kahneman’s “Thinking, Fast and Slow” about a study on how humans mentally rewrite memories of the process with the outcome. They study how the memories of an event are overwhelmingly dominated by its outcome. I guess it is true for my sojourn in the land of the bree and the fave. . 2016-2017 Bangalore . The idiot is back from abroad with a mountain of debt. . Thankfully despite being awkward and bumbling, I managed to get a good job quickly primarily due to happenstance and connections. You can notice the trendline of my self-esteem. . Perhaps hearing about my existential crisis from my million readers, the parents decided like all tropey Indian parents that Yours Truly should be inflicted on some poor girl. One thing led to another and I ended up meeting the love of my life. She is amazingly patient with me. Further details about our marriage are out of the scope of this time period and post to be honest. . 2017-A week or so back . I remain awkward and bumbling and very rarely blogged except for trying out static page generators. I flitted between different Hugo themes and there is still a Netlify page1 online. Opening up an entire IDE is rather cumbersome just to write some words to be honest. Then I heard about how to use Jekyll themes and GitHub Pages. The rest as they say is history. . And that is how I finally end up here… . ‘Til Later . 1I plan to transfer that domain to this page eventually. .",

The book attempts to teach Scheme/Lisp using the Socratic Method. Concepts are introduced in a question and answer format. . Socratic Method Example . Question Answer . Is it true that this is an atom? &#39;1492 | Yes, because 1492 is a string of digits | . What is the car of l where l is &#39;(a b c) | a, because a is the first atom of this list | . What is the cdr of l where l is &#39;(a b c) | &#39;(b c), because &#39;(b c) is the list without (car l) | . … and so on. . Based on the 3 chapters I have completed so far, it is really engaging. . Primitives . It starts with the concepts of atoms and lists of atoms and then gradually introduces functional programming, and specifically recursive functions. They are built on a platform of primitives that are present in Scheme/Lisp. The primitives I have used so far for creating my own functions are: . car - returns the first element from a non-empty list Law of Car states that the primitive car is defined only for non-empty lists . | cdr - returns the list l without (car l) Law of Cdr states that the primitive cdr is defined only for non-empty lists. Cdr of any non-empty list is always another list. . | cons - returns a list formed by adding an atom to the front of the list Law of Cons states that the primitive cons takes two arguments. The second argument to cons must be a list. The result is a list. . | null? - checks if a list is composed of zero S-expressions Law of Null? states that null? is defined only for lists. . | atom? - checks if S-expression is an atom . | eq? - compares two non-numeric atoms Law of Eq? states that the primitive eq? takes two arguments. Each must be a non-numeric atom. . | Functions . A function in Scheme has the following template: . (define funcname (lambda (arguments) (function_definition))) . For example, a function that checks if an argument passed to it is a list of atoms or not is defined as follows: . (define lat? (lambda (l) (cond ((null? l) #t) ((atom? (car l)) (lat? (cdr l))) (else #f)))) . All the functions I have written so far can be found at: Little Schemer Functions Repo . The Commandments . The methodology to compose functions correctly can be expressed as commandments. The ones I have studied so far are: . Always ask null? as the first question in expressing any function | Use cons to build lists | When building a list, describe the first typical element, and then cons it onto the natural recursion | Always change at least one argument while recurring. It must be changed to be closer to termination. The changing argument must be tested in the terminating condition: when using cdr, test termination with null? | The above is a summary of the contents I have studied till now. I hope to add more posts as I learn more. I will be updating the functions I create in the same GitHub repo. . ‘Til Later .",

Nevermind, I am sure you have heard of Nietzsche. The department I represent studies Eternal Return. In layman’s terms, it hypothesizes that the universe keeps on recurring infinitely in self-similar form. Many people were understandably outraged as it implies that there is no such thing as free-will. Our department was involved in testing this hypothesis by travelling to certain instances in the past that are of historical significance and poking and prodding to see how it affects the present. We noticed that our present is drastically different from what we knew unless we travel to now.” . He was now getting a feeling of foreboding. . “What do you mean?” . “Just that, you are a lynchpin of our future.” . “How so?” . “Unless I told your good self Something, that will completely change the course of history as we know.” .

            "title": "A List Too Short",
            "content": "On the one hand, I am not a fan of condensing almost two decades of reading (Yeshu Christu I am getting old!) into a list of a few books. On the other hand, it is a good opportunity to reminisce about all the great and not so great books I have read and also to introspect about what books have really influenced me. I think it deserves more than a short Facebook post and hence this blog (I have an exam tomorrow which is always a motivation for me to do something else, so why not something creative!) . A chronological order seems the best to do so. It is unfortunate that a lot and it is really a lot of books that would not be part of this list because of sheer paucity of this list as well as of my memory. I mean no disrespect of course and I might come back and edit this list if I feel I missed out on something significant. I am hoping to make a list of the books that have shaped me the most and will be describing why. There will be spoilers of course so tread carefully if you will. . Explorers on the Moon, Herge – My dad reading Tintin and Asterix stories to me with different voices for different characters is one of the most delightful memories of my childhood that I have. My love for reading has to be attributed to the many stories I heard from my mom and grandmother as well as my dad insisting that I read a paragraph of something before he reads out the rest to me. I include Explorers on the Moon to this list because the first paragraph in it with the suspenseful panel where Tintin and co are still out cold and Earth control is nervously waiting for any sort of response from them. . | David Copperfield, Charles Dickens – I think I have never got around to reading the unabridged version of this book but I still remember the anguish I felt while reading the abridged version when I was 7 or 8. The death of character after character who were important to David, “Crorkindills”, Peggotty, Uriah Heep and the Micawbers are some of my most vivid memories about this beautiful book of love, loss and eventual happiness. . | The Three Musketeers, Alexandre Dumas – Swashbuckling musketeers, swordfights, treacherous evil villains, gold, revenge, how can this book not captivate an imaginative boy! “One for all and all for one”, the evil machinations of Cardinal Richeliu along with being confused (still am confused) about how to pronounce D’Artagnan (as well as pretty much everyone with a long name), frustration at his youthful jumping into everything idiocy, reverence for Athos, admiration for Aramis and a feeling of camaraderie with Porthos are the things I remember most. I read Man in the Iron Mask much later but despite being a really good book do confess to not getting the same rush from reading it as I did with The Three Musketeers . | Valley of Fear, Arthur Conan Doyle – Sherlock Holmes is one of my favourite characters of all time and I will defend him over the various “cerebral” oddities of Agatha Christie with my life. To be honest, I loved the many short stories of Sherlock Holmes more than the novels. The Adventure of the Dancing Men, Lion’s Mane and Speckled Band are my three favourite short stories among them. I am not including short stories in this list for the obvious reason of this list never finishing. In case of novels, it was a toss up between The Valley of Fear and The Hound of the Baskervilles for my favourite Sherlock Holmes book and this wins out mainly because of the frustration I felt at pronouncing hound rhyming with wound all the frigging time! The tense atmosphere throughout this book is something I hated and loved at the same time. . | The Prisoner of Azkaban, J K Rowling – I include this over Goblet of Fire despite loving that more because this is the book in the series that I read first (I read in the order 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7, yea I know I am a weirdo :P)and thus got me hooked into the wonderful world of magic, muggles, wizards and quidditch. The movies after part 3 were terrible just fyi. . | Foundation and Empire, Isaac Asimov – The GOAT of science fiction writing in my opinion (of course, this is my blog duh), Asimov’s Foundation is possibly one of my favourite series ever. The sheer scale of the stories, the magnificent concept of psychohistory, Daneel Olivaw, the Mule, Gaia, so many wonderful memories from this series! I list Foundation and Empire because again I read this one first (order of reading 2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 6, 7) and also because the part where Ebling Mis and Bayta Darrell are trying to figure out where the Second Foundation is absolutely spellbindingly pageturningly tension-filled masterful writing. . | Lord of the Rings, JRR Tolkien – I am going to cheat here and mention the trilogy here as a single book because Tolkien did publish it as a single book :P. The godfather of fantasy writing, my reverence for Tolkien knows no limits. The fact that he was philologist creating a mythology for the languages he loved to make absolutely captivates me. The scale of Middle-earth, the wide range of strong characters, the wonderful battle scenes which capture the glory and tragedy of war, Gollum and the Nazguls, and the almost countless other beautiful details, Lord of the Rings is my favourite work in fantasy fiction. I noticed a recent trend in consigning Tolkien to a children’s author with the current rise in popularity of the Game of Thrones franchise but that is absolute unadulterated nonsense. Tolkien is basically the guy who invented fantasy and we can disrespectfully disagree over whatever your conflicting opinions about this are. . | Wizard and Glass, Stephen King – This is the fourth book in the Dark Tower series. The Dark Tower series was written by Stephen King over a time of nearly 30 years and it is a masterful work of fantasy. The way in which you grow to love the eccentricities of the main characters and feel a kinship with them, the concept of Ka and Ka-tet, I confess to being absolutely distraught at the conclusion. Drawing of the Three and Wolves of the Calla are also wonderful books but Wizard and Glass is my favourite because of the stories of the young Roland Deschain. . | Mrityunjaya, Shivaji Sawant – I read the English translation of this Marathi epic and was left wondering how good the original is if it was even better than the English one according to people who have read both! This epic does a magnificent job of telling the story of one of the most interesting characters from it, Karna. Cast aside by his mother, mocked by his brothers, used by his best friend and still strong in his convictions, Karna is definitely my favourite character from the Mahabharatha and this book reinforced that feeling. With its wonderful poetic prose :), switching points of view that narrate the story in a beautiful way and the obviously gripping story as anything related to the Mahabharatha is, Mrityunjaya is something for everyone’s shelf to read and reread. . | Fever Pitch, Nick Hornby – The book that made me realise how good sports fiction as well as a book about a random person with nothing distinctive about him can be. This is the story of an Arsenal fan and I could relate extremely well about how once you are caught up in the football fever, everything in your life revolves around it. The narrative follows a really interesting way of describing life events in terms of Arsenal matches. A must read for all football fanatics. . | I am already regretting making this list because of the books that I have not listed! Opinions and comments are welcome. .",

            "content": "Life is becoming something that happens between Liverpool matches. Football matters again. Football. Not owners. Not sides. Football. — Chris (@ChrisLawley77) March 1, 2014 . Never were truer words spoken. I have moved to a different country. I am meeting lots of different people. I am learning new things every day. I am realising that everything doesn’t work according to a checklist. In short, my life has changed a LOT. But all of it is dominated by one thing. Liverpool FC. Liverpool Football Club. The 2013/14 season of Liverpool. . I am crazy about football. I think of calendar years in football season terms. It is always 13/14 rather than 2013. I shout and cry like a madman when my club wins or loses. I call it my club even though I have never been to England let alone Liverpool. For some reason that only football fans can understand, I feel affinity to an entity in a part of a country which I haven’t ever visited or may not even be able to visit. That is football. Bloody hell eh? . I am elated when Liverpool win and descend into the deepest despair when Liverpool do not get the result that is expected. Till last year, it was more of the latter than the former. But this season, since August it has been different. My club has been good. It has been great, playing the kind of swashbuckling football that is the envy of all. . Our team is wonderful. It is incomplete but it is a joy. Our strikers are the best in the league. One is a maverick genius who creates moments of such pure magic in every match that we blink our eyes and wonder whether if we just saw that. The other is a prodigy in his own right. An instinctive footballer who was mistrusted by all but is now proving his talent week-in week-out. . We have a tiny Brazilian magician who is inconsistent yet but is a delight to watch when on song. We have a precocious winger right from our youth ranks. He is the pride of all. We have two young midfielders who work hard and contribute when the chips are down. Our defense provides lots of comic relief. Finally we have our captain who is a titan in world football. The best midfielder that the English shores have seen. We are a young team. With a young manager. A brilliant guy who has his own ideas and has adapted the best ideas from elsewhere. The team never loses hope. The fans are learning to do that. . We are fun to watch for the neutrals. We play beautiful fast football. We score lots of goals. We thumped the top team. We thump mid table teams. We thump bad teams. We have scored more goals at this stage of the season than any team in premier league history. We are on course to outscore every but one team since the 38 game season started. We have our flaws. But we seem to be learning from our mistakes. . We are also in a title race. That is unbelievable progress in 2 years. All the supporters expected a challenge for the 4th place and maybe losing out by a few points. Everyone just wanted improvement and a sign that there was progress. Till now, the team has exceeded everyone’s wildest expectations. We have the weakest squad in the top 6, but still are placed just 4 points from the top. Everyone has sat up and noticed us. . Of course, no trophies are handed out in March. But it has been a wonderful ride so far. We might crash and burn from the next match onwards. We might also go ahead and win the damn thing. Everyone is dreaming. The elusive 19th. People are afraid to say that aloud after so many false dawns and crashed dreams. But screw that. I want to believe in something. Football, the great escape. I walk around the house singing “We are Liverpool tra la la la”. I sit and contemplate about the various permutations in the matches left to play. I wonder what will happen If. . I wait for the weekend when my beloved Liverpool play. I know that Liverpool will score. That has been the one constant this season. . I smile. .",

Circumstances and a gigantic amount of luck has led to me being a student again. This time as a graduate student. It has been a rather interesting journey so far with its fair share of gaffes and idiocies. . After a heart-stopping weekend in which everything looked to be collapsing around me, it got better and I set off on 8th August to Chicago via Frankfurt. Things that I learned over this flight: . Fever and cough are not the best travel companions. I had contracted a bad fever and cough and was on heavy medication the entire week but didn’t recover in time for the flight. So was carrying an arsenal of cough syrups, antihistamines and antipyretics (tbh, I wrote this sentence only because I think anti-pyretics is a rather cool word). . | Don’t drink Espresso. It is just bitter black water. Being a poor graduate student, I thought I will save 0.25 euros and drink the cheapest thing on the menu. I almost threw up! Finally managed to dump a ton of cream and sugar in it and swallowed it with pinched nose. . | Being a vegetarian is hard. Particularly in non-Indian flights. My connecting flight was United and god my meals were bad! And people don’t ask you what you want, they assume that you are a non-vegetarian and I almost ate turkey and cheese gouda. But thanks to my spectacular English, I realised that turkey meant some fowl play(wink wink) was on and asked for my dues. And was given the coldest sandwich I have ever eaten in my life, almost froze my teeth! . | Airports are huge places! Frankfurt and Chicago airports had trains running inside to take people from one terminal to another. . | I should not have watched all those English movies with subtitles on. At first I found the language really difficult to understand.

Hat tip to the random senior I met at the university who dropped me off at home seeing my helpless situation. .

            "content": "Pooram is a Malayalam word meaning a festival dedicated to a goddess. And when the word pooram is uttered, the first thought in a Malayali’s mind is the Thrissur Pooram. . With their ridiculously funny tune while speaking, indecipherable slang and wildly eclectic tastes (there are fans associations for elephants), Thrissur, a district in central Kerala is home to some of the most eccentric people in all of Kerala. And it plays host to the Thrissur Pooram, probably the biggest congregation in Kerala after the Makaravilakku day at Sabarimala. . Fireworks, elephant processions, exhibitions, bands (pardon the crude usage but cannot think of an equivalent word in English), drunk people, you name it, the Thrissur Pooram will have it. Despite my mom being from Thrissur, I had not had the opportunity to attend it at all for various reasons, the most important one being that it happens usually in April, which being the month the Delhi government in its infinite wisdom has decided to hold classes. . A short history lesson: The Thrissur Pooram was started by Raja Rama Varma, popularly known as Shakthan Thampuran (the strong king). According to the story, temples around Thrissur were not able to ready themselves in time for the Araattupuzha Pooram, the biggest Pooram in Kerala at the time. They got debarred from the festival as a result. Shakthan Thampuran, angry at this, decided to start the mother of all Poorams in Thrissur with the Parmekkavu Bhagawati and Thiruvampadi Bhagawati as the presiding deities. The festival happens annually on the Pooram naalu (star sign) of the Medam month (according to the Malayalam calendar) and is held in the presence of Lord Shiva in the grounds of the Vadakkunnathan temple. . Well how did I finally manage to witness it? I had landed in Thrissur for some bank-related stuff on Friday morning. Having no return tickets for Sunday led me to extend my stay in Kerala for one more day. By a rather fortunate fluke, it was the Thrissur Pooram weekend. Urged on by my grandmom, I went to see the sample vedikkettu (fireworks) that night. I had been hearing about how good the vedikkettu is all my life from my mom. And to be fair, it was an understatement. The sheer power of the sample vedikkettu blew me away. And I was promised by my cousin who was my guide that the actual vedikkettu is even more impressive. My mind was made to see the complete Pooram. The rest as they say is history. .",

Mom was not present at that time as she had gone for shopping. When she heard about our fight, she immediately became angry and started scolding me. She threatened to revoke my computer privileges. .

            "content": "I am hungry. The lack of football is starving me. . For a passionate fan of club football, off-season might be the most torturous period there can be, with the international breaks providing stiff competition. No blogs to read, no players to swoon over, no players to shout at cough Downing cough and no more late-night matches and subsequent drowsiness all through next day. Sitting on the edge of the seat and praying that all our players make it through the break without injuries is no fun. . Granted it was not total lack of football. There were the Euros, making it much better than last year’s off-season, but somehow I did not enjoy it as much as everyone else seems to have done. Ze Germans, of whom I have been a fan since that 2006 opening goal by Lahm, were not as exciting as the last World Cup. In 2010, ze Germans were a fast counter-attacking team and tore many teams to shreds as England and Argentina will testify. Ozil and Muller with all there umlauts were so much fun to watch and the speed at which they converted defence to attack was breathtaking. This time though, their movement was more languid, more focus was on possession than before and except for the second half against Greece, never left second gear. Still it was a surprise when they went out to unfancied Italy pouring water on the German-Spain final that many football fans were hoping for. Spain seemingly as disappointed at not getting Germany as everyone else, then brutalised Italy in the final. . After a long long trophy-less stretch, Spain have won their second consecutive Euro Cup and made history by winning three consecutive tournaments. Vicente Del Bosque, the Droopyesque coach of the team became the only manager in the history of football to have won all three major tournaments, the Champions League, the World Cup and the Euro Cup. The talent for Spain, with brilliant players like Javi Martinez, Mata, Muniain, Llorente and many others still waiting on the wings is absolutely worth salivating over. Only Germany have comparable wealth in hand, but in spite of reaching the late stages of many tournaments they have choked. With experience in the squad that might improve though. Spain are now the champions at all levels and unless something drastic happens, it is highly probable that they will rule over football for the near-foreseeable future. . All that I am still not a big fan of Spain. The purists might enjoy the controlled build-up starting from the goalkeeper, the endless inter-passing, the waiting for the gaps to occur and the sudden rapier-like thrust at the most opportune moment, nowadays referred to by the fashionable name of tiki-taka, but I find no sight more enjoyable than the sudden turn-over of possession in our own half, the excellent controlled long ball to the striker or winger who is waiting as an outlet, the streaking into the opposition’s half at a manic speed and before the other team is aware GOAALL! An audacious chip from the half line and it is even better. The new manager of Liverpool, Brendan Rodgers is a fan of tiki-taka and I might well have to bring myself around to enjoy the poor man’s tiki-taka that Liverpool will dish out. Hopefully we will get into the Champions League next season. . It is not all silence at the club level though. Only one activity seems to be going on but its roar is deafening. Yes, I am talking about the transfer window. The transfer window on the continent opened on July 1st and all sorts of crazy rumours have started flying around. Players getting linked to every other club, agents sniffing around for their 15%, players not signing contract extensions, Arsenal fans committing mass suicide (the last two are said to be linked) and in short total bedlam reigns over Twitter. Whenever a new player is linked, within moments a video detailing all his goals, tricks and celebrations appears on the interweb. A video welcoming him to the club also appears. The player at that time is sugar, spice and everything nice (Yes, I used to watch Powerpuff Girls, sue me). Then suddenly a tweet appears rubbishing that link and linking him somewhere else and the player suddenly turns into a person not fit to tie the laces, let alone wear the precious shirt. Rinse, lather and repeat. Bat-shit crazy, this transfer season. . Thankfully, the actual season is not as far away as it seems. What with preseason and Europa League qualifiers (Europe!), the footie starts very soon. Another season of hope (“this is our year!”) is nigh. .",

            "content": "Bus rides can be broadly classified into two types: long and short (genius no?). . The short ones I love and the long ones I try to avoid like the plague. The short bus rides are for example from the bus stop opposite your house to the grocer two blocks down, or even to the Big Bazaar across town. I like sitting peacefully observing my co-passengeresses, gazing out of the window or reading a book. I also like running after crowded buses, trying to get a foothold on the foot-board and hanging out of the bus in quintessentially Indian fashion. . These short bus rides are of course not everyone’s cup of tea. Hanging on for dear life all the while inhaling the “fragrance” of the salt of the earth and if god forbid it rained, the socks of the earth can sometimes cause even the hardest person to feel the strain. Arguing with the conductor for the change and the driver because he doesn’t stop at your stop as well as alternatively apologising and antagonising your co-passengers for stepping on their foot is one of the traits of a bus ride in Hindustan post Jesus H. Christ. Nonetheless, I enjoy every bit of it. . The bus rides I try to avoid are the long distance ones, the ones across states, countries or continents. A suitable example will be the one that take you from one city full of people sporting backpacks, ID cards and earphones to one in the Naalikerathinte Naadu where you have a house like a Narayanakkilikoodu. Or maybe from one place in the latter to another, sufficiently far apart that the language of one is incomprehensible in the other (that is much closer than you might imagine). . Even the sight of the big bulky bus bounding down the road fills me with trepidation. I remember the countless babies crying their tiny hearts out (at extremely loud volume nonetheless) and the buckets of vomit the trajectories of which miss my face by whiskers. Thank god that I don’t have whiskers! I shed a silent tear thinking about the thousands of beautiful girls that sit in the seat just in front of me while the seats adjacent to me are occupied by people who are carrying enough luggage to last them a lifetime or the inquisitive people who appear to be unable to take their next breath until they know everything about me. I shudder remembering the overturned buses and smashed junks that litter either side of the highway that connects my usual destinations. Cutting the description short, I quake like a jelly and my timbers start shivering. . You would be excused if you conclude that with this great phobia of long distance journeys, I do most of my travelling via train. If you belong to the ilk which believes in planning and foresight, the aforementioned conclusion is almost foregone. There my dear reader, your ignorance of the creature called Damu shines through. Damu, rather I, has(/have respectively) never thought ahead of the day’s breakfast compared to some people who have even thought of the breakfast of the kid they will have in some 10 years. If somebody graded my planning on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being the planning of the grasshopper for winter and 10 being the planning of Rohilettan, I will get somewhere in the region of -10. . I eagerly wait for the day when IRCTC reduces its reservation period from 4 months to 1 day. 4 months! I laugh in their faceless faces at their gross presumption. 4 months! Ha ha. 4 days and you are talking business. 1 and you have got yourself a deal. Till that day, I swallow my fear, harden my nerves and take that shaky step on to the footboard of the Rajahamsa, that humble steed that carries my noble self everywhere. . ‘Til Later .",

            "title": "Biryani",
            "content": "No, this post is not about biryani – one of the most overrated dishes in my opinion. . I find the various spices and all in it disgusting and only eat it if I am left with no other option. In my living memory (I wonder if there is something called dead memory), I have only liked biryani twice. But if I remember right, both times I was starving. Even when I think of biting the clove or cinnamon or cardomom, I gag. Yuck! But then, I am a vegetarian and what the hell do I know. . I am sure at least a few of my Malayalee readers would have seen the movie called One Man Show. And by now, I am sure you must have realised where I am leading to. For the others, no worry, all in good time. The movie has a mad character played by Salim Kumar. In it, he is interned in a lunatic asylum and wreaks havoc with his antics. In one of the best scenes of the movie, he creates a massive charge of his fellow lunatics. When dragged aside and asked what they were doing, he gleefully informs that he told those idiots that free biryani is available near the front gates. Then he is asked why he is running after them and he replies that he is also running because, “engaanum biryani kittiyalo”, which translates to “what if biryani is actually available”. . This wishing for a non-existent or rather improbable biryani, the “what ifs” are a defining part of us. This optimism for the improbable is intrinsic in our psyche and varies only in how far one is optimistic. Even the worst pessimist is an optimist. This optimism is expertly utilised by most advertisements. What if I become fair, what if I lose weight, what if I gain height, what if I get hair back etc etc etc. The entire betting industry revolves around this optimism. Everyone knows that out of a million lottery ticket holders, only one is going to win the bumper prize, yet they imagine themselves to be that person. The higher the odds, the more one feels confident that this is the day. Maybe that is also why four or five lakh odd people write the JEE, the AIEEE or the myriad entrance examinations where the selection percentage is less than one. Hope springs eternal. . How was I reminded of that “class” dialogue? That brings us to point after a long ramble in the neighbourhood of everything but the point. You must have noticed the current prominence of something called Zurker, apparently the creation of the losers of Facebook (bullshit of course, the makers are totally different people). Zurker is a new social network that they claim will revolutionise the entire concept of social networking, the iPhone of social networks if you will. Welcome to the community owned network where every networker is an owner of the network. It is their advertisement strategy that is brilliant, and is the subject of this post. . They promise every networker to get a share of the network when someone he/she recommends join it. The company goes public when a million shares have been distributed. With the IPO of Facebook expected to be of the order of several dozen billions of dollars, even the most pessimistic person is hoping for a share value of a few thousand at least. People are thus optimistically spamming on Facebook (the irony), Twitter, Gmail, blogs and every other possible place they can. . The leprachaun gold at the end of the rainbow is enough for people to tote out essays on why it could not fail and is a guaranteed source of income. Just reach that magic number and enjoy the loot. What could possibly go wrong? You just have to ask Google+, Orkut, MySpace, Friendster and the multitudes of networks that have come and gone with the wind. But if this optimism is changed, I guess we won’t remain humans anymore. . The thrill of the improbable, almost impossible, happening is something which lends magic to our lives, gives us something to look forward to. The underdogs pipping the favourites, the favourites pipping the underdogs expected to pip the favourites and so on. There are a gazillion million possible eventualities and life will be far the worse if robbed of the hope for the one single version that suits us. Life is beautiful as the most hoariest of cliches go. . In related news, you can join Zurker by clicking on this beautiful link. Of course I don’t want to be the one left without the metaphorical biryani though the literal one can go and stuff itself. Or do we stuff ourselves with biryani? God knows. .

            "title": "A Train of Thought",
            "content": "Last Sunday, I saw the Malayalam movie 22 Female, Kottayam. . It is about a nurse who is abused by people whom she considered close to her and how she wreaks revenge. Nothing groundbreaking, almost the illegitimate offspring twice removed of Ek Hasina Thi and Kill Bill (and for once acknowledged by the makers). It was though quite a different movie from the dominant fare in Malayalam, no over-aged fat hero trying to carouse with a million girls less than a third his age nor a superhero who defies all laws of physics while bashing up the baddies while mouthing punch dialogues at the same time. I liked the movie, though I can’t say I enjoyed it because that would make me a rather sick person. . But this blog is not a critical review of the movie. Rather this is a about a train of thought that was triggered while watching the aforementioned movie. I can’t actually say triggered because I have thought about it earlier too but only now am I actually putting it into words. It is about a factor that influences how we appreciate, enjoy or empathise with the characters, let it be a movie or a book. . It is a three letter word that starts with S and ends with X. Not in that way you pervert, though that might play a significant part too. I meant sex as the gender. I have felt that the gender of the character plays a very significant part. Big deal you might say, and I agree, nothing that others haven’t thought of. But I thought a long time about this, and so reader, I have to bore you too. . As a person who likes reading, I tried translating it to books that I have read. Then I remembered about Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini. It is a book that I have thoroughly enjoyed and a book that I will recommend to everyone. I enjoyed it much more than A Thousand Splendid Suns, by the same author. But while discussing about it with an aunt, she told me that she felt ATTS was much better. . The reason we felt totally opposite, I surmise was because she associated more with the female protagonist rather than the male protagonist of KR. Both undergo repeated misfortunes in their lives. Comparing the two is difficult and I guess is left to the reader. This I think led to the contrasting views about the books that my aunt and I had about the same books. . Going one step forward, I think I will associate more with a male doctor protagonist than a female engineer protagonist inspite of being (almost) an engineer myself. It might well be the most important trait of the protagonist which decides how I associate with the character. Putting it in a nutshell, the targeted audience matters a lot for me while appreciating a creation, let it be a movie or a book. Sidney Sheldon with his female protagonist and Harold Robbins with his male protagonists targeted different audience. Stephanie Meyer targets an altogether different audience which can’t be easily characterised, though giggly, pink and immature are the words that immediately spring to the mind. Without deprecating books with targeted audience, I have felt that a book is truly great when any Tom, Dick or Harry and Eena, Meena or Deeka are able to equally enjoy it. . Reading through my prolonged discourse on people of literary merit far that I can’t even dream of reaching, the thoughtful and eloquent reader might have been wondering how the !@#! is this related to the movie I mentioned. Spoiler Alert, if you want to watch the movie, don’t read on. The female lead as I mentioned is repeatedly abused and finally cheated by a guy whom she loves. As revenge and to prevent him from further abusing anyone, she castrates him. . Ouch! Inspite of everything that happened earlier, and knowing that the suffering villain was a total douchebag and a vile person too, I could not help feeling sympathy towards him. I felt queasy even as I thought about what happened to him. I guess the feminine half of the audience felt the same when the heroine was abused. The director targets both audience here knowing that both will be equally affected and this is what I think makes the movie really good. . The movie-going public has started demanding different films than the usual. Many big budget movies with the usual plot sunk without a trace. What with movie rights and all, a movie doesn’t fail totally but still it vanishes from the screen which can be said to be a failure. This demand might also attribute to the meteoric rise of a certain person without no shame whatsoever who does everything in his movies, including directing, writing the story, penning the lyrics, playing the hero and dancing with the 7 or 8 heroines, all equally poorly. I have felt the said person to be an affront to our collective sensibilities, but some people like him, so there you are. . In some of these offbeat offsprings of the intercourse between the demanding public and new directors, societal issues are being addressed in a more straightforward manner than the allegorical or metaphorical portrayals earlier, swearwords are coming in (which is a big step indeed) and ‘variety’ plots (lifted from elsewhere of course) are being used. Whether all these are forward or backward steps is something that is difficult to say at the moment. History after all moves forward*. . But sometimes I hark back to the good old days when I could enter a theater blankly, laugh a lot, enjoy the songs, ogle at the heroine and come back without anything on my mind, let alone such gruesome images. Movies are no longer an escape to another world, but becoming a window to the rather sick world that we live in. . ‘Til Later *A quote by Nassim Nicholas Taleb of Black Swan fame .",

            "content": "Well, that break proved to be unusually refreshing. . I am back from that self-imposed exile where you would have found me more difficult to find on the social network than water on moon. This exile was triggered by what many may think to be one of the silliest reasons possible, a game. But when that game turns out to be football, undoubtedly the most popular game on the planet, then it might not be too silly. . To cut a long story short, when my favourite football team, the one to whom I have sworn my allegiance, the one whose fortunes decide my mood of the day and the one who is yet to attend the class Goal Scoring 101 began playing even more horrendously than usual and started going from one nadir to the next, I decided to take a break from everything and come back refreshed. This entailed skipping twitter, where I almost exclusively follow people related to football, all the million blogs which were mirroring my despair, FIFA where I used to play the actual match again and also Facebook just for kicks. And then I realised, I had nothing else to do online. . I curbed my usual habit of opening a hundred tabs and roving from one tab to another, everything related to football. Sometimes out of sheer force of habit, I would open a few of football related sites, but then remembering, I would close my eyes and quickly close the tab, punch myself in the face, dip my hands in boiling oil and walk on fire, or mostly only the first. I went on a pilgrimage, meditated on the futility of it all and understood some fundamental truths about life. That the pilgrimage was part of a trip to Delhi and was not a conscious choice but rather a choice of the parents is another matter altogether. . 3 weeks of that self-imposed exile and I found out that I had more time than I even knew. The serendipitous benefit of the exile was my reading. Books, which I used to leave for the rainy day, the offseason when there was no football, the time when I was free from doing my million other responsibilities were quickly finished. I am glad to say I read many fine books. I also discovered the rather humbling fact that if I read a book a day, I would not finish even the classics in my lifetime. I am now exploring authors who are talked about with reverence, the people who shaped the literature of their times, the literary giants on whose shoulders stood many a Chetan Bhagat and achieved bestsellerdom. Though even these giants might have been the Chetan Bhagats of their times, upcoming novices mentioned sometimes as an afterthought. . I broke my exile today on learning that Liverpool (the team that I follow that is) won a match. Was I relieved on coming back into the folds of “society”. Not too much. It is still bickering, sharing weird photos to get “likes”, refreshing a page to see if the like count increased, trying to be witty or pondering on the perils of playing a deep-lying playmaker. I discovered that the exile was not so much of a trouble, rather I enjoyed immensely the time I had. Maybe I am just an ordinary anti-social being, a sociopath if you will. The anti-library (a library containing the unread books) is more than 99.999% full. . Of course, the football bug, once caught is not easily cured, and once my team goes back to its winning ways (if there ever was one), I am sure I will get hooked on again and cry and delight with my fellow fans. But this promise I solemnly make, that unnecessary worry I will not take. After all it is only a game. .",

He tried opening the door with the key and ran through the entire bunch before finding the fitting one. . “Unbelievable, if I had started at the other end, it would still have been the last key.” . It was pitch dark inside and so he began searching the pockets of his jacket for a torch he was sure that he had. He promptly found a screwdriver, three screws, a chewing gum and even the key to his previous car but not the candle. Shaking his fist at the spectre of Murphy gloating malevolently over him, he resigned himself to his fate and began using his mobile to navigate around the house. . “Let there be light”, he muttered sardonically while switching on the mobile light. He peeked a glance at his watch. He was quite behind schedule. He had a midnight flight out of the country to catch and the car was coming in less than fifteen minutes. In that time he had to pack everything as well as clean up. Remembering the spate of robberies in that neighbourhood he made a mental note to not leave anything valuable behind. . He went into the bedroom and started checking the various almirahs and drawers to see if he had missed anything. She had told him to clean up the place before he left. He hated the cleaning but knew that she will give him trouble if he did not follow what she said. He shuddered slightly remembering the last time such a thing had happened. He felt a faint tingle remembering the lashings that he received. . “Women! No point arguing with them. As somebody wise told, a man has got to do what a woman has told him to do. Or was that something different? Who cares.” . While cleaning up, his mind started wandering and he began thinking about his job. Years of experience had lent a mechanical bent to it. Truth be told, he was quite fed up with his work and wanted to start afresh somewhere. He had almost quit several times but financial difficulties as well as the fact that he was not much good at anything else always brought him back. . “Beggars can’t be choosers and at least I am better off than some of my ex-colleagues”, he consoled himself. Finishing everything, he took a quick glance to ensure that everything was fine and walked out. . “Shit, I forgot to call her. She will be livid. And where is that bloody car? It was supposed to be here five minutes back.” . The car came almost at that moment and identifying himself, he got into it. And the car drove off. He took out his phone and dialled her number. . “Ma’am, I have done everything you told me. I am going to the airport and will be out of the loop for some time while I enjoy that well-earned holiday.” His tone belied how intimidated he was by his boss. . He threw his phone out and taking off the mask and gloves which were stifling him, he began enjoying the wind blowing in through the open windows of his getaway car. .",

            "content": "According to Wikipedia, I was a graduand till a few days back. . Who are they to judge, you might ask. The fact that you ask that question implies that you have been living in a hole for the last few years. Welcome back Rip Van Winkle, we now have colour televisions and internet. Wikipedia is the new bible. Where was I? Ah, graduand. An eminently Commonwealth word, it refers to a student who has “completed” his graduation but has not yet graduated with a formal ceremony. And the university solved that problem with a convocation (or convo as we cool people call it) ceremony on the 20th of January. . With most of our class being in Bangalore itself, there were many of us in the train that took us to the alma mater. A fun journey as all train journeys are, we reached the ‘city’ of Kozhikode on the morning of the convo. Some noobs had turned up the previous day itself as the official website had told us to be present there for some rehearsal and registration. But our mole in the college had told us that it was all bullshit, so we sauntered in on the relevant day only. . The necessary registration and collection of gowns/robes was done. The dress had a caution deposit of Rs 1500/-(one thousand five hundred only). Shocking. It is not as if we are silly immature people who can’t be trusted to tie our own shoelaces. Oh wait, we are. Then we proceeded to our… oops erstwhile (sniff**sniff) hostels to dump the bag. Some people had to carry out their daily routines while the rest of us less disciplined folks waited for them. Then we were all ready for breakfast. . But waiting for one of our flock stuck in Bombay resulted in our delay in going to that hallowed thattukada, our haunt for three years, the place which fed us and kept us out of shape during our college days, that abode of the master of tea-making Vasuettan and the excellent Chechi. Words fail most of us while waxing lyrical about the food there. Some people have stopped drinking tea anywhere else after tasting a sip from Chechi’s, fearing losing that divine taste from the tongue. The person with the best vocabulary of “nice words” in our group slung poetical rhyming swear words at the delayer for delaying us and we ran there fearing that all was lost. . Our fears were almost realised and we had to make do with the second best options available but the divine tea was there to compensate. Feeling very sated and at peace with the world, all at the cost of 20 rupees, smiling benignly at all and sundry, we then proceeded to meet the favourite teacher(s). A lot of fun was had at the expense of some people who give lifts to girls on bikes as well as some people who go to gym when some people are rumoured to come to Bangalore. But alas I can reveal no names. . The convo was scheduled to begin at 3:30 in the afternoon(duh!) and after quick showers and a lot of time deducing how to wear the robes, we went to the Audi. There we learned that the robes have been wrongly worn and after long duels and almost endless namecalling, we finally decided to wear it just as it is. And then I entered the audi. . And then I entered my mistake. The chief guest coming from Saddi Dilli had his flight delayed as a result of the awesome fogs due to the awesome climate in awesome Delhi and it was no fault of the Delhi which is the awesomest place that I know of. But I digress. The nub of the matter is that he was late and some of us were left stuck in the hall with no entertainment other than sitting and twiddling my thumbs while watching grass grow and paint dry. You might wonder why I did not take my awesome iPod but then you were not aware of the stupid rule that no cameras and stuff were aloud. Then you will argue that the 0.3 megapixel camera in the iPod does not qualify as a camera and then I will grab your throat for blaspheming about an iDevice for I am an Apple fanboy. But again I digress. . The ceremony finally began two hours late with loud trumpets and the academic procession entered the halls with great fanfare. The next thing I remember was people going on the stage to collect their certificates. The speeches were said to be excruciatingly boring and infinitely long. My name was finally called and I went on stage all humble and bowing and promptly lost my hat. But being the resourceful person that I am, I converted that mishap into a curtsey and got my photo snapped without further problems. The degree told me that I got through with a First Class with Distinction, talk about awesomeness, which gathering from the expressions on people’s face when I tell them my marks, I would hardly have considered possible let alone probable. . The fact that we were stuck in the hall for around 5 hours left us ravenously hungry and the juniors were blessed from the bottom of our hearts when they provided us refreshments. Then I ran around making hasty farewells and searching for the friend who had promised a ride home (his not mine). The aforementioned friend having been found out, gathered Yours Truly and the one who got mocked for the bike incident and took us to his home. And the convo trip that most of us had been waiting for ended. . A huge thank you for all the friends and teachers who enabled me to stumble through four years of college with a degree in hand to show for it. And I am now a graduate, fellow homo sapiens. A graduate from a not too shabby university in India. Bring on the world now. I will shove that degree in their face. Or burn it along with the rest of the stuff when the world ends in 2012.

And guess what the best part of attending those functions were? Naa, not the girls, a saying I heard recently comes to my mind-“Most of the beautiful girls are not present, most of the present beautiful girls are not single and most of the present single beautiful girls are not present without their brothers”, certainly lolworthy as the chat addicts say, eh? Where was I? Ah yes, the best part - the sadya. . Sadya (suðya-the su is pronounced like in sun, the weird character like “the” and a short ya instead of the drawling yeah) is a Malayalam word which means feast or rather banquet as a sneak peek at Wiki tells me. Nothing new about that you might be thinking. You with your experience in attending a million random weddings and gatecrashing another million or so might be thinking that this is just one more such occasion, nothing that a very innocent look and blustering about till you get it right won’t solve. . Unfortunately, no. Not so easy buster. I admire your blissful ignorance because it is one of those occasions that a person alien to the culture can be totally sidelined by the others and left looking like a total nincompoop.

Dhoti/Mundu or Lungi, as the culturally backward call it, the thinking mans’ cloth is one of those fiendishly tricky dresses which forces you to think about hereafter while you are trying to tie it. It looks quite easy but many a stranger has tied himself in knots trying to tie his Mundu. And it is a must if you want to properly participate in a sadya. You might need a professional Malayalee’s help for the first two thousand times, then you can manage it alone. Why a Mundu, why so much bother, you might be thinking. And you will not be alone either. But trust me as I trusted my Shifu. Here are a few reasons that will force you to think. . You are in a different culture and what better way to merge with them than trying to adopt their customs? Also any of the pretty girls that escape the aforementioned rule and you would like to merge with might find your troubles with the Mundu rather cute until it turns rather vulgar. . | Any time somebody gives you something to pass the parcel to someone, you can just say, “Sure, just hold on till I retie my Mundu“. By the time you manage to retie it the unwelcome person would be long gone. . | And most importantly, the food is going to be pretty spicy. And v’la, you have acres of space to blow your nose or wipe your sweat or whatever other nefarious motives you may have. . | Preparations . Skip breakfast- you came a long way to attend this marriage, and what better way to enjoy it than enjoy a hearty lunch? . | Go to Mumbai and practise getting on to the local train. “Huh?” you might ask. In Kerala or at least at whatever marriages I attend, people always need to get on to the next local train. So there is always a huge huge rush when the first panthi– loosely translating to a crowd of ravenously hungry people- is set. I have personally known people (yes I am looking at you) waiting outside the dining hall when the actual marriage ceremony is going on. . | Go to the nearest garbage dump, stare at the refuse and try to maintain an appetite. Because that is how the hall will be if you do not manage to enter in the first panthi. . | The Day . Get yourself a seat, somewhere away from prying eyes and suspicious aunties and wait calmly for the food to arrive. Take a look around and see if anyone is watching you. Smile at them till they are embarrassed and look away. Now take a look at your table if your appetite can handle it. . Hey, wait, don’t use that leaf thingy to clean the table. That is supposed to be your plate. First take some water out of the glass they have kept and pour it on the leaf. Now thoroughly rinse it using your hands. What? You did not wash your hands? Ah well the damage is done. Check whether the leaf is torn or has holes. To remove the leftover water on the leaf, grab your leaf by its nearest side and push it over the edge of the table. Of course you idiot, you need to hold the leaf. Beg the leaf guy for another leaf and repeat, this time holding the leaf while pushing it over the edge. Now that your plate is ready, use the mundu to wipe the beads of perspiration. I told you it will be useful. . I am sure you are a professional eater, so only a few tips regarding the eating part. Food will arrive as multiple courses and it is never rude to raise your hands and ask for more. Pappadam (not possible to translate to English), kadumanga (the pickle) and chips have to be suitably used as garnishing while eating. Oh shit, one more thing that I forgot to tell you, you have to eat with your hands. No spoon, fork and knife. It is highly efficient and makes the phrase finger-lickin’ good quite apt. Also remember the fact that unless you have at least 4 glasses of payasam (the sweet), the server will look at you with disdain. . There you are, a successful sadya eater. And with there being more Malayalees than everyone else (Yes Mandarin is just Malayalam with a Thrissur slang), you will find plenty of occasions to satisfy your urge. Have fun and don’t waste the food. . ‘Til Later .",

            "content": "“Rhino- check” . “Duck-billed platypus- check” . “Clown fish- check”, God counted in a very satisfied voice. Heaven was a very busy place at the moment as all the holy ones had gotten together to look at God’s latest craze- a Lego collection to rival Satan. He even had breathed life into his models and the things were looking quite impressive. “What say you, my dear fellow? Unable to eat anything because you still can’t digest that my collection is better than yours?” asked God. “Not bad, considering that you spent the better part of the last 7 years since I threw my Lego collection party trying to make your own”. “7 years! No man, I have been doing this only for the last 7 days. In fact most of the things were made within a day” . And that my dear friends is how exaggeration was born. . Exaggeration- what a beautiful word, what a beautiful idea. I would not be exaggerating if I said that this is one activity, nay art that I am a champion at. Being a champion of this art as well as this cause, it is my honour-bound duty to instruct those less able than me on this. As I said, exaggeration is not something that everyone is good at. It requires careful planning and innovation. Keeping that poker-face while making that outlandish claim is not simple. Even inventing those outlandish claims is very difficult. There are several unwritten rules which will help you get away with exaggeration. Here you are. Read and study. . Rule Number 1 . Multiply by n rule. If arbitrarily increasing a count introduces a twist in the tale in your favour, that count should be multiplied by n (which is usually 10). So the next time you tell about your marks or the number of goals in Legendary mode against Barcelona with Sheffield United, just add that extra zero and enjoy the zing in your tale. . Rule Number 2 . Divide by n rule. If arbitrarily decreasing a count introduces a twist in the tale in your favour, that count should be divided by n. God is one of the eminent people to have perfected the use of this rule. Note: This rule is particularly effective when combined with rule number 1. . The above two rules were actually discovered in Ancient Greece while trying to encourage the Greek soldiers waiting for Xerxes army. 3000 Spartans suddenly became 300 and 5000 Persians suddenly became 50000. . Rule Number 3 . Eyewitness rule. You always witness everything worth witnessing. The Counter Strike match which lasted 10 days or the athlete next door doing 150 push ups using his pinkie finger were all in your presence. Always. . Rule Number 4 . No names rule. As long as you don’t name names, you can’t be caught exaggerating. Pronouns were invented exactly for this reason. And people reciprocate when they know they have not been compromised. So it is always “You should have seen HIM eat. At least 30 Idlis!” And “HE” will be more than glad to say something nice about you too. . Rule Number 5 . Swear on the name of every family member possible. A fine example would be “I swear by the last fur on the tail of my Great great grandfather’s favourite labrador that whatever I said happened.” . The above five rules should enable you to invent exaggerations. But the following rule is the most important one when it comes to getting away with it. . Rule Number 6 . Quote the Author rule. Quote Shakespeare or Bernard Shaw. Or better Leo Tolstoy. No one reads those authors. While making claims, follow it up with a quote from one of the above mentioned authors. “He was so angry that he beat up at least 10 people single-handedly. Like Tolstoy said in War and Peace, anger is the greatest friend you have. It can render you power to defeat even your greatest enemy.” . Rule Number 7 . This is the most important rule of all. Pray to Damu. Remember his wisdom. Think about all his greatest attempts. Get inspired by his exaggerations. Read his books on exaggeration. Whenever you feel doubtful, remember the golden rule that Damu knows everything. A good book to start with will be “100001 great exaggerations by Damu” ghost written by Damu. . The most important two rules are 6 and 7 and you will quickly notice that their product is 42. What? You don’t know what is special about 42? Just google “the answer to life the universe and everything” and enjoy the beauty. Yes, the magic number strikes again. And yes this is my 42nd post since I joined the blogosphere around 2 years ago. That it took me so long to reach this holy number is as much a testament to my laziness as the chronic uncreativity that is present in me. But there you are. For every creative, zestful, enthusiastic fool, you need a Damu to maintain the precarious balance of life. If you are reading this, thank you for persisting with such a lazy devil in the hope that he will come good. Hoping for many more blogs… . ‘Til Later .",

            "content": "Jeeves is a character who I suppose needs no introduction. . One of the most well-known creations of Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, he defines himself as the “Gentleman’s personal gentleman”. A valet of supreme intelligence (rumoured to eat only fish-hence his brainpower), tact and ability to handle all situations, Jeeves is the person to go to if you have a problem, a fact Bertram Wooster would gladly testify to. Nothing fazes this supreme human being, a charging bull and a raging aunt are handled with the same cool composure that renders them purring at his feet. . This volume of the omnibus has two novels and a collection of short stories involving Jeeves. The first of these is called The Mating Season and is a laugh riot involving a medley of adorable lovers, the bumbling Bertie, horrible aunts and of course Jeeves who stands tall amid the chaos. PG Wodehouse does not write suspense so I would not be spoiling anything if I say that in the end, Jeeves brings order to a chaos ridden world of multiple lovers confused about who they love and Bertie trying to escape from the attentions of the extremely irritating Madeline Bassett. . The second novel is called Ring for Jeeves and according to Wiki is the only Jeeves novel in which Bertie does not play a role. Socialism happens to England and all the nobles are learning to do their own jobs instead of depending on their entourage of servants to do everything. This has also resulted in many of the peerage losing their livelihood and this book dwells on one such earl who wants to sell his dilapidated manor. The story begins with the entry of a rich beautiful American widow, a big game hunter madly in love with her, and all hell breaks loose. And the stage is set for Jeeves to solve everything. A mad car-chase, theft of valuable pendant and a gamble at the biggest horse-race of the year are all beautiful parts of this beautiful novel. . The last part is a collection of short stories each with Bertie in a bigger soup than before and he is saved from each mess by the quick thinking and enterprise of Jeeves who rises to each challenge. . A thoroughly enjoyable book which had me in splits most of the time. My room-mates were quite sure I had gone mad as I was almost crying with laughter many times in the day. A must-have and a must-read for everyone who enjoys pure humour. PG Wodehouse is a master at this and reading each and every single book that he has written is one of my ambitions. . Stephen Fry who plays Jeeves in the series about the duo said the following about Wodehouse, . You don’t analyse such sunlit perfection, you just bask in its warmth and splendour. Like Jeeves, Wodehouse stands alone, and analysis is useless. . ‘Til Later .",

It is something which strikes me every now and then when I go through an inordinate number of books at a rather quick pace. In the last 10 days I have read 5 books, not bad eh? Arrogant !@#!@ you might be thinking, but what the hell :)! . I was going through a rather lean spell in the reading department when I decided to buy two books at once. They were Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy by John Le Carre. I was actually going to buy only the former paying heed to the dire warnings by ICICI about the state of my funds but when I saw that Flipkart had increased the minimum amount for free delivery, I thought what the hell and ordered the other too. And that opened the proverbial flood-gates. A lunch at a nice hotel opposite our house finally led me to step into the hallowed premises of JustBooks. I had been giving the place a wide berth relating to the aforementioned depletion of funds but once I went inside, there was no escape. . For the uninformed, JustBooks clc is a lending library with a host of plans for different types of readers. It has a very large collection of books and all the books are beautifully maintained. They also have a very modern system with RFID cards for the members and similar tags on the book jackets. After going in, I couldn’t wait to go back as the Jeeves omnibus Vol 3 and Silmarillion were too hot to handle in my hand. I took the plan for 200 Rs, by which I could borrow two books at a time. There was a joining fee and a refundable fee. The best 1.5 k that I might have spent in recent memory, I might add. . I will try to give a short review of the books that I have read in the span of the past few days, hopefully a post a book and hopefully something that might lead you to one of these books all of which I quite enjoyed. . ’til Later .",

            "content": "Crime . An awesome trip was conducted over the weekend. The details of what happened are still unclear but the victim – Damu (male, 21) is now seen to be deliriously happy and repeating the words “Dudhsagar awesome trek Rohilettan genius Abhayoppol awesome” in no particular order. . Suspects . . Rohil aka Tuppi aka Chettai– Uncle from the victim’s maternal grandmom’s family. We are still investigating why he calls him ettan (brother). . Abhaya (no aliases available)- Rohilettan’s wife, technically the victim’s aunt but as above he still calls her oppol(elder sister). . The above two are rumoured to be the masterminds behind this operation. . Rachana aka Ammu– Niece to the above two. Owns an awesome Ipod and clicks very good photos. . Ashwin aka Shutterbug aka Aniyan– Brother of Rohil. Is rumoured to be a sharpshooter. . Vinita aka Ammu &amp; Uma aka Ani– Relatives of the victim’s favourite aunt. The inseparable duo, they have made a pact of answering opposite to each other. . Roopesh aka Maashu– Colleague of Rohil. The strongman of the group. No other details are available about him. . Crime Scene . . Dudhsagar, very close to Goa, along the Konkan railway, isolated scenic location, with a waterfall as the backdrop, an ideal place for the crime of above-mentioned description. . Details of the crime . Though the important details are still not available as the victim is still having a hangover of that awesomeness, the following picture has been built by interviewing the suspects. . The victim is believed to have reached the Bangalore Central Station around 8 pm on the night of 16th and was met by Abhaya. The others except Ashwin soon joined him and were seen to have food at the ubiquitous Come Sum. The group caught the Rani Chennamma express but were seen by many bystanders to be waiting for a train while it was already on the platform. The victim was the one said to be the first to realise the mistake. . The group landed at Londa station close to 730 am of the 17th and waited for Ashwin to join them. Everyone except the victim had food and he was observed to be noticeably excited about the trip. Ashwin’s train took them further on to a station called Kullem where they were met by a car sent by Dudhsagar Resorts. . The resort, a brilliant place seemed to be rather empty and the group split into 3 groups as they moved to their tents/outhouses. The tents were fully furnished and the victim shared a tent with Ashwin and Roopesh. Rohil and Abhaya were in another tent and the rest of the girls in the third. The rest of the day was spent inside the tent of the victim and the group was said to be saying “Oh Hell!” several times over. . . The place was also in an uproar over games of Dumb Charades, in one round of which the victim was said to have made a memorable performance in which he enacted one movie by enacting the dance in another classic movie. The food was reportedly quite good and all the suspects agree that the victim had a really fine appetite. . The group departed in the early hours of 18th to Kullem railway station where they caught a passenger train to Dudhsagar waterfalls. They got down at the station and after this the details get hazy. They walked the distance to the actual waterfalls where the victim was said to be quite astounded by the beautiful falls as well as the scenery. . . The group then began the 15 km trek towards Castle Rock, a station close to Londa. Everyone seemed to be well-equipped for the trip as the masterminds had sent everyone mails about the things to be carried. . . The victim made short spurts to the head of the group and would gradually fall back and this process was repeated many times over. . . He was in a right fine mood and was heard to be loudly singing songs that he was hearing over a displayless mp3 player. Occasional stops were made to rest the tiring legs as well as to let the trains pass. The victim wearing a new pair of shoes was seen to be walking over the roughest terrain in order to “mothalakkal” (sic) the shoes. . Intermittent showers had the group sometimes under cover and sometimes sweating their way. . . The group then stopped for a light lunch at a small station and were well provided for because of the ruthless planning of Abhaya. Rohil was earlier seen to be gulping down his packed lunch when the group had a small stop. The journey then continued though there was some debating over whether to try to get aboard a goods train a la “Chaiyya Chaiyya” with the group finally deciding against it. Energy levels were soon seen to be flagging though the enthusiasm was at an all time high. The group finally reached Castle Rock close to 430 pm with everyone dead tired but extremely happy to have been able to finish the trek properly. . . They then caught a train to Londa and returned on the Rani Chennamma express itself albeit in 3 AC. The victim in particular was seen to be gushing over Rohil’s vision and foresight in booking an AC ticket to compensate for the arduous trek. The group reached Bangalore station close to 815 am on 19th and Ashwin was seen to be cursing the inefficiency of Indian Railways. The trio of Ashwin, Abhaya and the victim then departed towards the Sarjapur while the others went on their respective ways. . Handsome rewards including brownie points will be awarded for people with further information about the trip and especially photos. The photos can be shared by Picasa as one the suspects (Rachana) has already done. .",

            "content": "Last Saturday night, I got a sudden phone call from G asking me if I was coming to HP and the DH part 2. Why not, I asked myself. . I was not a huge fan of the movie franchise, with its inexplicable deviations from the books, wooden acting by most and the utterly horrible Dumbledore. But the movie was a good way to meet Achu, Papps and BleeJ and hey a movie at 100 bucks in Bangalore, I was game. So I dragged myself there, and sat down to watch the movie, with all the paraphernalia needed for the 3-D effects. . A slight background is needed for this. The first 3-D movie that I saw was My Dear Kuttichathan when I was very small. It was a wonderful experience, with flaming arrows coming at the audience, ice cream which almost seemed to be at touching distance and so on. I remember thoroughly enjoying it and therefore went and saw Chhota Chetan when it released. By then, the kiddish charm was missing and the fun was far less. Then recently I saw How to Train Your Dragon from Chennai and again really enjoyed it, though I suspect that it was more due to the animation factor, the witty dialogues, the splendid Nightfury and the majestic voice of Gerard Butler. And HP was the next in line. . A review of the movie is quite redundant methinks. Except for a few who managed to live in a well for the last few years, everyone knows the story of the boy wonder who is fighting an evil wizard. And I had very little expectations about the movie. I expected Harry to act as badly, Ron to look as stupid and Hermione to look as gorgeous respectively as they usually do. I knew that the story will be good and expected a few deviations here and there. And yes, my My Dear Kuttichathan memories wanted me to dodge a few Avada Kedavras as they flew thick and fast out of the screen. I wanted to become the next Boy Who Lived. But I just became the Boy Who Got Disappointed. Not a single spell came out. Not even a teensy Expelliarmus, Harry’s wonder solution to all evils. I consoled myself saying that maybe I can dodge a few Death Eaters or maybe have Hermione within touching distance. But no. Nothing doing. The only thing that I got from the movie was a splitting headache. The movie was surprisingly good. And the few deviations there were were not as bad as before. But I am flummoxed by the decision to make it 3-D. . I wonder why it was made in 3-D. Yes, there was the depth effect but Hollywood has survived close to a century or maybe more without that. There is the moving with the times thing and yes there is the money thing. My knowledge of the technicalities of cinema like the screenplay, camerawork, and such is quite limited. Show me a movie with a decent story, camera not shaking too much and decent actors and I am happy. I am not the one to judge the shadow effects or the amount of detail. The absolute layman that I am, can someone please tell me what is so special about 3-D. I mean what is the target audience, what is needed to appreciate a 3-D movie and such. I for one feel that this movie would have been much better without the 3-D effect. Till I understand that no more 3-D movies for me. .",

As you might know, I was scheduled to join Tejas on the 11th of July but was suddenly called to join on the 20th of June. Unlike what I thought, Tejas had no great problem that only the mighty brain of Yours Truly could solve. Hmmm, that day will come but currently it was just a matter of splitting batches into equal groups. So we arrived 3 weeks in advance and underwent a sort of induction into the company, what it does, what are the important products and such. A Non-Disclosure Agreement that I signed prevents me from revealing how boring it was, but you can guess. . A positive thing about arriving early was that we got pay for 11 days. The company had opened an ICICI account for me and the stuff duly arrived at that account on the 30th of June- my first Pay Day. At this juncture, I remember a Calvin and Hobbes strip. . . The Sister was gifted her first gift, the first piece of music that I ever bought and it had to be Taylor Swift, but such is life and the happiness of The Sister more than compensated for the shame I felt on betraying the greats and buying Taylor Swift. I also indulged myself by buying two books, both of which were duly finished within no time. . I finally met the fabled creature called The Manager for the first time. He was quite nice and explained about the organisation and promised us a lot of challenging work, when we were finished with our training. He just asked to brush the cobwebs around our digital electronics and also gave us some documentation to read, but he did not mention any deadline. I guess he expects us to finish all that when we next meet which is almost a month away. That is a lot of time! I got a cubicle and a computer but currently am perfecting my carrom skills. I have hit a few beauties but still am a long way off from any sort of consistency. As they say, such things don’t last long and therefore I am utilising it as best as I can. .

That statement might have informed you to the fact that I am still at an age when I want things that look nice but may not have any use. . So I bid a hasty adieu to Blogger with links to my Tumblr account. Then I thought why not learn something about my new home. So I went to The Ultimate Reference and searched. . Imagine my chagrin when I found that it was supposedly a microblogging site. You might be wondering what is wrong with micro-blogging. Twitter is a chartbuster and everyone who has any pretensions to being cool regularly uses it to inform everyone what cool things they are doing or broadcast cool stuff like the easiest way to become cool. But my experience with Twitter or tweeting as they call it has not been that good. I know it is my problem as I have commitment issues and seemed to use it only during exams. I did not want my blog, my wall, my precious to decay like my twitter account and therefore have decided to not use Tumblr (which after all is a micro-blogging site). . So there you are, I am on WordPress. I lasted more than two years on Blogger which is long considering how impulsive I am. As a result of that longevity I expect WordPress to survive longer. Let us see what happens. Here is to a long and fruitful partnership with WordPress, Cheers! As you can see, I have maintained almost everything as it was in Blogger, including the URL, which I have to say was one of my better inventions. So please continue following me if you ever did or start following me if you ever didn’t. Who knows, I might become a award-winning author one day and you can say proudly to everyone that you used to comment on my blog when I was a nobody. Nurturing budding talent and all that you know ;). . My first proper post will come soon. .",

            "content": "Yes, that is what it is called. According to the Ultimate Reference, it is described as follows, “In humans, this condition is also commonly known as male pattern baldness. In classic pattern baldness, hair is lost in a well-defined pattern, beginning above both temples. Hair also thins at the crown of the head. Often a rim of hair around the sides and rear of the head is left. This is dubbed “Hippocratic balding”. Rarely, the condition may progress to complete baldness”. . Little did Arun know how close to the truth he was when commenting on a previous post, about me transforming to a balding something person. Yes that is exactly what I am slowly yet surely transforming to. Every strand of hair that pops out as I casually touch my head warns me of the impending doom. Each bottle of those miracle hair tonics smiles weakly at me as if it is telling me that it is good but not designed for such extreme cases. And I languish in the certain knowledge of what is going to happen to me. . Ah, the good old days, when the name Fountainhead was an apt tribute to It. The days when the visits to the barber were a necessity. My hair would have grown wildly and densely and would be protruding in all directions. The barber seeing me approach would give a loving glance of appreciation at the vegetation and grin widely at having an opportunity to practice his art. . He would painstakingly set all the tools of his noble trade on the table and ask how short I wanted it to be with great apprehension. And I would give a regal wave and say with casual nonchalance “Bilkul Chota Kardo Bhaiya”. And he would give a huge sigh and begin his work. The battle of wits between the artist and my locks would follow and the wily barber would have to use all the tricks that he ever learned to tame the foliage. At any point of time, there would be a trimmer, scissors of varying shapes and sizes, combs of several textures and a bottle of water on the table. . And the battle rages on. . Slowly I start resembling a normal human being instead of Mowgli and finally it admits defeat to human ingenuity. The artist that he was, he would flash me a grateful smile for giving him the chance to prove himself (the hair lying on the ground which was enough for a wig or too might also be a possible reason). . And we come to now. The necessity has transformed to a ritual, a rather farcical one at that. Something that we do just as to retain the old tradition. Like the kings still being called Your Highness and all inspite of being just common me (pretty rich common men yes, but still common men). . A memory of something past. . Sort of like going and renewing the subscription of the science magazine, not out of necessity but rather as a ritual, I go to the barber every two months. . Why two? No idea. Maybe it is the second part of 42. Or half the first part of 42. The great number has many ways of manifesting itself and it is not up to us mere mortals to question that. . So two months it is. The barber on seeing me gives me a look, at once a mixture of disappointment, disgust and disdain. Somewhat the look given to a student who inspite of his early promise goes wayward and derails from his path of greatness. . He mutters to his friend, ”Chai garam kar lo, main abhi aata hoon” and beckons me inside. I quietly ask him not to make it too short and he gives a grunt. Taking immense care not to disturb the flora too much, he pats the old egg here and there and sort of puts on a show for around 5 minutes. . I pay him the charge, and walk morosely back, one hand on the mane which had challenged many a barber, the other hand trying to count the days before even this walk won’t be needed. .",

            "content": "A short account of my impressions about Tejas will come as soon as I get an idea of what it does, which might take very long. . So right now I will be writing a review of this book I read about somewhere as a must read for cricket fans. That time I was not that much into cricket (read pre-World Cup time). How a hardcore cricket person like me lost touch with the gentleman’s game is another story altogether. Then recently during the holidays, I heard about a person called Sidin Vadukat writing for Cricinfo. That entire afternoon I split my sides laughing at the masterpieces that he had composed and considering that it was a day I was feeling low, I owe him for cheering me up. He also praised this same book and being indebted to him, I felt that I should buy this book. So I did and just now finished reading it. . Somebody has described this book as “A crazy ambidextrous delight” and it is spot on. A crazy story is exactly how I would describe it. It is a fascinating insight(?) into the world of a cricket team that I loath with all my heart, Sri Lanka. And if you remember that 54 run bowled out or Mendis running through the entire team or the semifinal of 96 or the scary sight of a small target appearing daunting at the prospect of facing Murali, then so should you. “Gamesmanship” “sportsman-spirit” bull-shit aside, it is hurting to see the team that you love lose. As someone said, “Show me a good loser and I will show you a loser”. . Alright I am drifting from the topic so back to it. As I said it is about Sri Lanka in general, more about Sri Lankan cricet and especially about a quest to find the greatest spinner in history. No this is not about some talent-hunting reality show, it is about a search for a bowler whom the narrator believes is the greatest spinner to grace cricket, a genius who could do things with the ball that the supposed greats could only dream of. This genius was capable of bowling some of the most exotic deliveries like the Double Bounce ball (which spun twice) and that too with either hands. He was also capable of perfectly mimicking the bowling actions of anyone. Many of the greatest achievements of Sri Lanka seemed to have started from him, most notably the Great Lankan Opening Batsman’s utter disregard for technique and still becoming one of the greatest players in their history and undoubtedly cricket history. He is also attributed to have introduced sledging to the otherwise meek Sri Lankans. . The aforementioned narrator is a severe alcoholic and is dying and wants this quest to find this bowler of mythical proportions to be his last contribution to the literary world. He is a part of a dysfunctional family with a son who ran away to become a rock star and brothers with whom he is not on good terms. His only allies are his neighbour who is a statistician. The story follows the search in a rambling manner with diversions and detours but without losing the grip on the plot. There are several anecdotes about players, and as it has to happen the great Turbaned Indian Commentator does pop up. The book has a very good ending where I really got confused about what was fact and what was fiction. On the whole a very enjoyable book where you are introduced to some really nice characters whom you get to like even with their quirks and idiosyncrasies. . Unputdownable? Maybe not. Must read? Hmm, if you are a fan of cricket, then yes. Enjoy this rollercoaster account of the enigma that is Sri Lankan cricket. .",

The company that will eventually employ you, replies the person and I finally realise that it is me mum who woke me. A short conversation later, I realised that I have been asked to drag my lazy self to Bengaluru or Bangaluru or whatever by 20th June. Ohk… but that is like only a week away. And though one of my friends seems to own IRCTC (I am looking at you Amar), even he will find it difficult to get tickets at such short notice. But then they tell me to fly there. And I agree. And the tickets are booked for 19th June. And Bam! I am leaving home. . So after all my drivel about the holidays stretching like for eternity, it has come to a rather quick end. As I write this, it is finally sinking in that I am less than a week away from flying away. And like the fledgling that flies away when it finds its wings, I am flying away too. After a fantastic 17 years at home and school and an unbelievable 4 years for the first time away from home, I am going in search of my life. The nest remains open for me and come back I will whenever I can. . Come 19th and I am finally on the road. Not in the way we use it in Malayalam! But more nicely:). This is a nice time to borrow from a master. As He said so will I: . The Road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the Road has gone, And I must follow, if I can, Pursuing it with eager feet, Until it joins some larger way Where many paths and errands meet. And whither then? I cannot say. .

The set-top from Sun has gone bust and therefore I am stuck with only a few channels, and however much I enjoy seeing ManU getting beaten, it is getting rather tiring. So I am stuck in front of the comp. But as my father has work to do on it, my time on it has been cut short to a 10 to 6 window. Thus I am now quite a pro on Hearts (thank god I never knew how addictive it can be while in college) and my virtual pro on FIFA has started getting all sorts of traits and attributes so that he may soon turn out to be a personification of his name – Damn Trikki 🙂 (Please excuse my indulgence :p). . With the actual football season over, the only things going on are the Euro qualifiers and the transfer window. Liverpool seem to have already spent 12 mil+Eggnogg on one 20 year old. Hope he turns out good and capable enough to knock Stevie off the team. All sorts of rumours regarding players are flying around and this being just my second window as a hardcore fan (earlier I was just a casual fan of L’Pool and did not pay much attention to other details), its rather exciting and I spend more time on the Offside and Kopblog than anywhere else. As every fan around the world is hoping, hope we get a good winger and a solid left back and then we are good to go to get back onto our perch 🙂 and back into Europe. Lets see what happens and of course in King Kenny we trust. . The days seemed to have been dragging along rather slowly but it has already been 2 weeks since I reached here. As I mentioned before, they have been a rather lethargic set of days but I am not complaining. I am expected to join Tejas Networks on July 11 and therefore have around one month left here.

            "title": "The Life Of Pi by Yann Martell",
            "content": "Caveat: There are a fair bit of spoilers. . This is a book that I have been hearing about for the last 3 years thanks to my Dumb Charades playing friends, where this was a usual question alongwith having to name the author. This has again been a book that I have had regular access for the last 3 years thanks to an uncle. Yet me being me, it took me 3 years to finally decide to read it. The reading part took a lot less time, and just to ensure that I understood and remembered something, I thought of writing this review. . It is a wonderful book. Kidilam as we used to 😦 say in college. Haunting and somewhat terrifying. The author starts off by telling how he got the story for this book. He begins with a meeting with the person about whom the story is and then the entire story is in first person. . It begins as a rather harmless tale about a kid who lives next to a zoo owned by his family. The kid is named after a swimming pool and is a really good swimmer. A very religious kid, he is at once a Hindu, a baptised Christian and a devoted Muslim. Life was going on smoothly till thanks to the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi, the family is forced into having to sell all their animals and depart to the “safer” shores of Canada. But the cargo ship on which they were travelling sinks along with all the animals on board and only the following escape: the boy, a zebra with a broken leg, a hyena, an orangutan and a Bengal Tiger. . This is the second part of the story about how the boy tries to survive on board a lifeboat with such a dangerous collection of a nimals, dangerous being a massive understatement. It is very interesting to read about how he copes with the many problems though it is slightly a la Robinson Crusoe or Coral Island, with the minor addition of the aforementioned creatures 🙂 . The third part is at most 5 pages in length and is the most terrifying part in the book. The boy is questioned by agents of the company whose ship the boy was on and they appear sceptical about his story. The boy then tells an alternate version of the story and its truly epic. Stunning. I was shocked by that version. . The book thus consists of two tales about the same trip and we are then asked to select the version we prefer to believe, one of incredible bravery in the face of disaster, the other about the utter depravity of man, the most dangerous animal of them all. . The story is written in a very engaging manner, with the author including details about the person who inspires this story. Quite a must read I have to say, and is worth every hour spent on it. The book is very informative too with lots of details about animals as well as about the religions mentioned earlier. But beyond all this read this book if you want to see how to totally flip an image that has been built over 250 pages. Read this if you like to place yourself as the protagonist and wonder what you would have done. Read this if you think of man as a superior being than others. If none of these hold for you read this if you think of yourself as a moral person, I think you would question your morality after reading this book. I know I did. . PS : When it comes to books, I like most of them. These are MY opinions about the book and thus please don’t tell me if you didn’t like it. Sorry, do tell me if you didn’t like and we can have an intelligent argument about it. Thus if you don’t like, then please tell me why. .",

            "content": "Nice to meet you folks again. What was I doing all this time? Where was I after promising something and then coming back after a while with nothing but a hastily conceived apology? . Well I was doing nothing but enjoying. Indulging would be a better word. Being fourth years and all that, the teachers sort of let us off the hook. The classes were less, there were no more labs and hence afternoons were off and moreover either a Monday or a Friday would have so few classes that most of us considered it sacrilege to remain here. There you go a perfect recipe for Indulgence. There were regular visits to the folks back home who soon started wondering out loud what I was doing there. And of course. there was an unwritten pact amongst us to add another subject to the curriculum ECU401 Travel and Tourism. . Hell yes, we travelled a lot. Starting off with a New Year in Kodaikkanal after a visit to Pazhani (yes you heard the combination correctly), we went off visiting Kasargod+Kannur (Bekal or Baikal or some other funny spelling), Goa+Dandeli, and rounded it off with an amazing experience of food and wonder at Idukki+Ramakkalmedu+Achu’s house(where we felt the glory of The Cup)+Parunthenpara. And this was excluding the trips back home that I made almost all alternate weekends. I also managed to attend a few quizzes here and there with Asan and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. . What else happened? Ah yes, this semester also had the whatshallIcallit “phenomenon” of Ragam which had among other things the most amazing ‘proshows’ by the Jai Ho team and Sunidhi Chauhan, tapping the energy of which alone would have solved the energy crisis in half the world. There were many other interesting events too, among which I vividly remember the StreetPlay of some team as well as the Fusion concert by All India Radio’s award winning team. Then there were some extremely difficult quizzes which I participated in and yes managed to come out feeling less confused than before. Even exams did not manage to dampen the air of euphoria that was present after Ragam. . Soon began the entire sequence of farewells and treats. I had managed to miss every single one of my friends’ treats so there was no letting go this time. And yes there were enough treats left to satisfy me. First I think we had the branch farewell organised by the juniors of our department which went really well, the crowning point of which was when I was gifted with a memento by one of my favouritest (Enlgish language is deficient accept it) teacher, then came the Enquire(read:quizzing club) treat which was held at a really nice hotel. I finally met my second year and first year juniors. There were some funny incidents during the thing, and hell I even managed to ad lib my way through a speech. Then came the best: the branch treat. All of us sort of treated each other but I guess the time we spent together was more important than everything else. We spent a lot of wonderful moments in each other’s company, poked a lot of fun at each other and overall had a smashing time. That all has happened in one short (too short?) semester . Fourth year! Gosh! Seriously! Really can’t believe the time has flown so fast. It is literally the end of an era, and I don’t mean it literally like those idiots who say “that was literally mind-blowing”. I mean it exactly as how a word-by-word translation to another language would convert it. Well I am digressing, but you know old habits die hard. Talking about old habits, you heard about the new… oops! sorry, won’t happen again. Lets start afresh. Where was I, ah yes, The End of An Era. The college has transformed us from rather studious kids (oh come on! you were a nerd too) to dare I say, more responsible (snickering in the background) mature (catcalls) engineers (outright laughter). All right, maybe not so much responsible or mature or even engineers, (I for myself will frame my degree and occasionally glance at it to confirm that I am engineer). But I don’t think anyone can argue that we have not changed from what we were when we came here. I must say I met the most wonderful people that I think I will be meeting ever. . Thank you Varma, Achu, 4, Ubuntu, Shakku, Firdu, G, Mannan, BJ, Muru, Kurian. Jay,RoPo, Kops, Paaps, GT, MK, Vindows, Allu, Klay Vee Gee, Ulesh, Vathsa, Abhi, Pamper, Asan (both), Annan and all my other friends for being the people you are 🙂 I guess this might be the last post I will be posting as a student of NITC. Even when I am writing this the feeling is not sinking in. Seriously! Or it might not be if I don’t study for the exams that are going on. So off I go. Thats all folks! Toodles! .

Hey don’t worry, it will not be a long drawn out narrative of all that I did since I began to remember. That is the job of my biographer after I become famous :). . I rather hope to write a series of blogs giving the most memorable moments and people I have met since my college life began.

I learned many things that I would never have learnt in the not ordinary course of life (engineering is the ordinary course of life now 🙂 ). I daresay, it has rubbed a few odd corners off me. When I joined this college I had no expectations other than maybe an IT job. To be frank, I had no idea what to expect from here. I had no idea what the standard of education will be, what type of teachers I will study from or even what type of people I will be studying with. My book of expectations was blank and was slowly written in as the days progressed. Maybe I had a small hope of making some good friends. Ah yes! I also wanted to be able to avoid alcohol and smoke.

And of course I have always been able to say a strong no to both alcohol and smoke. And yes I have stayed a vegetarian though I am not sure whether that is something to be proud of or not. At least I now have more confidence in my ability to say no. . If I miss anybody or anything in my description, it is only my bad memory at the time of writing that caused that miss. I assure that whoever you are or whatever that happened would have been included if I had perfect recollection of everything that ever occurred ( in that case I will be a miracle and would be writing this from the confines of a lab with scientists poking at my brain). Of course the journey this far has not been a smooth ride and there have been my fair share of hiccups and breakdowns. But what is the point of remembering bad things? I hope to maintain a rather lighthearted account of everything though I hasten to add that I would have more often than not understood the gravity of the situation. . So keep visiting once in a while to see how far my project has progressed. . Toodles .",

            "content": "One winter he sailed forth, Away, afar to the dark cold north, His mind set on the stories told, By voyagers young and old, He thought of that fateful night, When he ran away feeling light. . Tales of treasure beyond measure, Filled his heart with great pleasure, Lands so beautiful with fjords and brooks, Mountains and forests wherever one looks, But most he dreamt of the chance to see, Herja the Great valkyrie. . Her beauty renowned far and wide, As was her anger which swept like a tide, There was a hush when they spoke her name, All the noise it overcame, She rode upon a fair white horse, And ruled with force the mighty Norse. . The journey lasted many a new moon, He raved alone like a crazed loon, Storms tore apart the humble sails, The thunder silenced his rants and wails, Hunger and thirst rent his mind, No land or ship he could find. . One day he felt so tired and sore, He wept aloud and gave a huge roar, Cursed everyone who told him the lore, Decided to die and live no more, He ran and grabbed the only oar, But lo! he beheld a great white shore. . He rowed afresh with hopes high, A smile on his face only so wry, Paddled so much he ran aground, But screamed with joy and jumped around, Saw a forest and went inside, From the bitter cold he wanted to hide. . He strove on with much courage, Once again he felt young of age, Then there came along a fresh trail, Believed again that he would not fail, He walked and walked till he fell, Then awoke to the sound of a tinkling bell. . Wonder filled him as he became, Aware at last of the splendid name, Of the place he found himself, Tended upon by a noble elf, Whereupon he went he saw great lords, For this was Valhalla the hall of Gods. . He drank the sights and his soul was healed, Such powers the gods did wield, Once the wounds all did clear, Again the desire through his heart did sear, To see the Lady Herja great, He felt so sure it was his fate. . When the lords heard his wish they smiled, They said to him, “Dear child, We hope you pine for something else, For her eyes deep as wells, Will blind your mortal eyes, We assure you we speak no lies”. . But he would not have his wish denied, Peeked at her at a royal ride, The lady atop her splendid steed, She felt his presence and gave him heed, Blinding him before he would see, Herja the Great valkyrie. .",

I tried and tried and tried and tried, Thought about stuff till I almost cried, Wrote pages and tore them asunder, Decided that writing was a huge blunder, And this becometh the oath that I propose, Come New Year I will not compose. . “That seems odd” you might exclaim, And of course you are not the one to blame, For people commit to stuff they care, And here I am shirking my share, But think twice and you will realise, Breaking resolutions has always been my vice. . Is it the case of a double bluff? Or is it just somebody in a patch so rough, Certainly he has got his job, With chances of earning without having to rob, Even his grades are okay now, And for that my friends I take a bow. . But now I am stuck in a bigger hole, Like Liverpool when it bought Joe Cole, Then I sang You Will Never Walk Alone, But right now I am in No man’s zone, All my writing seems to be in vain, And it always leaves me very much in pain. . “Is it something that goes much deeper? Has he finally met the great Grim Reaper?” Alas my friends if it was only just that, For this one I could only scream “Drat!” As my Laptop my precious might kick the bucket, And leave me with my hair that I had plucketh. . It served me well and I served it well, Everytime I scored it gave a huge yell, I loved it with every single cell, Saved it from hurt even if I was the one who fell, Thus it is with great sadness that to thee I tell, That I will never buy a laptop which is made by Dell! .",

It remained one for a long time before the utter pretentiousness of the title finally bore into me. Naming it something which was not at all true began to gall me as it should any sensible person. Neither were the posts random, nor were they rants (hopefully), nor was/am I raving, nor am I in any way a good story-teller (yes that is what raconteur means FYI). I actually thought that the title was rather cool back then. But I guess I have matured with time. . Then I had an intermediate title which meant “Tale of Damodaran, Speak friend and enter”, but then it was a shameless rip-off from a master, whom I venerated beyond everyone and therefore felt that it was an insult to him, to name something so vulgar from one of his great works. That had to change and it did. I guess the spate of name changing has shown how clueless I am. I guess for the time being at least, for the near foreseeable future at least, till I mature even more and realise how bad the title is at least, the blog is going to be titled “Who am I kidding?”. .

So if you have enjoyed reading even one post of mine, please continue visiting as only the name has changed, the author is still the same.

One great thing that I have learnt is to talk to perfect strangers. A great way to kickstart a conversation, particularly during meal time is to complain about the food, and mention in passing that you have had a better experience at home. That is all that is needed for nine out of ten people to start reminiscing about the fond memories that they have had with home food. The cooking virtues of their mothers are then expounded upon in such detail that you feel duty bound to notify the people organising “Top Chef” that they need search no further, “Gentlemen we have our winner here”. Even extremely good food joints are rubbished when compared to the awesomeness of their mother’s food. “Dude, eat my mom’s dosa. Then Saravana Bhavan will feel bad to you”. Call me racist but the most susceptible people to this trickery are Tamil Brahmins. Just mention good food and then expositions of filter coffee, dosa, pongal, mysore pak(“it’s Mysore for God’s sake”), and the millions of types of Sadams will follow. Americans will be scared by the existence of so many Saddams, sambar saddam, curd saddam etc etc etc. Okay bad joke. . Doesn’t anyones’ father make food? My dad makes kickass payasam(“here I begin”), better than mom. What is the secret behind “Ma ke haath ka khana”? Why does all food have to be compared with it. I guess it will remain one of the great mysteries of life. Will 42 solve it? Many a domestic tiffs might have happened due to the unfair comparison of perfectly good food made by ones’ better half to the grand old lady. I guess I will tell my wife, “don’t worry, our progenies will exhalt the greatness in your cooking”. . Aah!!! POM makes me do everything else 🙂 .",

            "content": "”You have attendance shortage”- proclaimed the message that was disturbing my peaceful football match. (Fifa 11 is simbly awesome, can’t get enough of it!!!) . The message was from our class representative, a nice guy who does a lot of work and has a kickass t-shirt. I was struck dumb by that message. Not that I was speaking or anything, just a figure of speech (don’t know which one). I grabbed nothing (why should something be always grabbed when in a hurry?), hurriedly put on my chappals, and dashed downstairs just after confirming whether he was in his room or not. . The 100 meter journey to his room felt like eternity and Yours Truly had one of those metaphorical “Life paused for me” moments. The entire college life seemed to “flash before my eyes in fast-forward”. My placement procedure as well as all the “High” attendance records that I marked during the teacher evaluation seemed to be giving me the big middle finger on my face. Hell I was almost going out. Lame jokes of being 3/4 or pi/4 an engineer were scorning me. I began to think back on the semester that was. . The class which had just screwed me was undoubtedly one of the most boring hours of my existence. The teacher used to come in and immediately start writing on different sides of the board and by the time I looked up I didn’t have any idea of where to start writing. Of course the before-mentioned teacher had already taught us earlier and of course I was referring to that semester and of course I had got screwed in that subject. This semester I didn’t even bother to look up and was usually sitting as though attentive but in my dream world. Attendance time was the only duration of that hour that I bothered to pay attention to. . Or did I? Because after a few classes I realised that he just was not going to call my name. Rupesh Sah would immediately be followed by Vinay Kaimal and I was stuck in that big region of discontinuity. So I no longer bothered about attendance and sat there coolly whenever I could drag myself into the class. I generously bunked classes but still was aware that I was not that close to doom. But now I started doubting myself and my mathematics which had given me that false sense of security. I met one of my friends on the way and asked him what to do in case of shortage and was sensibly told to apply for condonation. But I didn’t even have a clue about what classes that I had attended and what I had missed. . So I walked, the walk of a man bereft of all hope, going to meet his executioner. And I walked and finally the 100 meters ran out and I was left with no choice but to meet my demons. I knocked, filled with dread, and entered his room. He was perched on his comp, with no worldly worries. . This is the conversation that followed: . Me-“Yaar mera attendance kya hua?” He “Kya hua?” Me-“Tera message aaya tha ki shortage hai”. He-“Mera?” Me-“Haan tera” He-“Tera number kya hai?” Me-“9037983452” He-“Toh yeh Dash ka number nahin hai? Main Dash ko bhejna chahta tha.” . And I walked out. .",

After a very relaxing holidays during which Yours Truly gave a new definition to joblessness, college had a rude shock awaiting me. It seemed that the placement procedure of which we had been hearing about for the last three years was finally going to strike our shores. . Thanks to my imba preparations during the holidays, I was caught as unprepared as the Grasshopper caught by the winter. The only preparations were regarding the costume, rather fancy dress that one had to wear for the ceremony. Thanks to my parents, who had high hopes regarding my being placed somewhere, I had a decent wardrobe with all accessories included. My dad even wanted to buy me a tie, but I somehow managed to convey that I already was looking like a nitwit with my black shoes and tucked-in shirt with full sleeves. Thus in that respect and that respect alone, I was prepared. . Then regarding the three years of studies which I had studiously neglected, I found out that I wasn’t even aware of the textbooks needed. Thus began a frantic preparation procedure, and anyone would have been surprised to find Damu who is usually never found in his room even during exam time, religiously waking up early and slogging away at a huge mountain of studies. Soon D-Day arrived, or did it? No, because GE which was slated to be the first company ready to take the risk of recruiting us decided to snub us in the face. Halfway through their PPT, we were told that they didn’t give a rat’s ass about BTechs and asked us to shove off. Well we consoled ourselves that we had a proper dress rehearsal (literally as well as figuratively). . Then the other companies started arriving, and after a quicky aborted attempt at studying programming, I decided to take only core companies seriously. That was easier said than done, as I was somewhere in the 30-40 range of GPAs. . And even now I am in search of a job. Is there any core company out there which recruits a person who likes English, reading novels, crossword, knows nothing (as of now) about electronics but is willing to learn anything??? Then search no further I am right here. . Signing off with some mathematical coinologies that have been developed considering the placement season. . Damu Distance – The Damu Distance of a person is defined as the number of pre-placement talks he/she has attended. D(I) = Summation(Pre-placement talks of all companies) [I is a random variable denoting an individual] . SPrem* Count – A mathematical extension of Damu Distance, it is the number of placement tests that a person has cleared. This has been coined after a legendary character who is rumoured to have cleared so many tests that the guy who guards the Placement department is on first name terms with him. .

If I were to write a book, it would start as “Call me Lazy”. I am as lazy as they come. In fact I am secretly proud of being so lazy. My autobiography will contain anecdotes about my laziness (quoting one, I once sat in a room without switching on the fan for hours on at a stretch at peak summer in Delhi, waiting for my mom to come from the other room and switch it on). Half of my replies to tasks to be done would be “Hey, I am too lazy”. . | The other half of replies would “I will do that later”. Weighing 130 pounds, here comes our World Procrastination Champ, king of all procrastinators, taking on the pretender (read 4). A magnificent procrastinator, able to delay anything including food (no no I am not kidding), I am now locked in a one on one fight with 4 who is claiming(tsk tsk tsk) to be a procrastinator. . | I like to read and read really fast. I mean I would browse through books (I do read everything) and read them again and again. For the record, I have read Lord Of the Rings 5-10 times. . | I lovvveee cartoons. I grew up with Popeye and Scooby dooby DOO and all. Even now I have a soft corner towards animated movies. In fact in my all-time favourite movies list, Finding Nemo and Kung-Fu Panda would surely figure. If I was in the Oscar jury, Marlin would have won the best actor award and Dory, the best supporting actress. . | I watch Harry Potter movies solely to watch Emma Watson. After thoroughly murdering the magnificent1 books, the only respite in all the films is the “Oh-so-Gorgeous” Emma Watson. . | I like to play computer games. I spend close to 12 hours a day in front of the computer during the holidays, playing games. God save the makers of Warcraft and Medal of Honor and Mario all the other beautiful games out there in the big wide world. . | I am no foodie, but Kerala can’t compare to Delhi when it comes to vegetarian food. The sensual feel of butter-laden Choley Bhathurey or the crisp crispiness of Gol Gappa can’t be matched by anything. As an afterthought, maybe a strong cup of homemade filter coffee can. Saddi Dilli I miss you sooo much. . | That’s All Folks. And before I forget here are the people who have been selected to the next round of “Who’s the It”. . Ganesh of Think Aloud, a guy caught up in the hectic college life and in a quandary about what to do. | Gman of Confessions of a Deranged Mind, our dear class-rep, the Kannur-loving, food-loving, movie and football loving genius. | Ubuntu of Life@NITC, the computer geek and the FOSS guy. | Jinto of http://untold-opinion.blogspot.com/, the meticulous guy. | Nithin Varma of Nostalgic-treasures, who I am pretty sure will never follow up. | Raghu of Aviyal, Nithin’s cousin and my only acquaintance with him being that I did a pushpanjali for him in Mookambika. | I am fed up and am stopping now. | Once again That’s All Folks .

            "content": "I know its a rather pompous title… but no other title came to my mind. . It’s striking how easy it is to come upon a clichéd topic. It is almost clichéd to write that you are writing about a clichéd topic. But write I must. If anyone guessed, well guessed…it is about my train ride back home. . The stupid college calendar had shown that our exams were ending on 30th. So the train tickets were booked early and I was all ready. But horrors of horrors, when the date sheet was put up, our last exam was on 27th. Several frantic calls later, it became known that all trains through Nowhere (as I like to call the place I study) were packed. So very cleverly, I booked my tickets from Hometown. After the debacle named disarmingly as exams, more about them sometime else, I boarded my bus and went to Hometown and boarded my train. . My seventh sense (sixth is my laziness) was already sensing something amiss when I entered my compartment and I heard a person talking loudly. I thought no more about it and went up to the top floor and slept peacefully till the morning (or rather afternoon). Cursing myself on missing breakfast, I got down at the next station and had a quick brunch. As I got back to my seat, I saw the person whom I heard earlier smile at me rather wolfishly. I smiled back with my own misgivings and sat down. Suddenly he asked me why I was looking so sleepy. Since I had just woken up, I felt that to be a rather irrelevant question but my eloquence failed me at that moment and I quietly replied that I overslept. Looking rather triumphant, he asked the next question which left me shell-shocked. ”Do you want a policy that protects you in case you oversleep?” . Good God, he was an Agent! Not any agent, not somebody from the Matrix but somebody far more dangerous… an LIC agent. And lo, the person sitting next to him was also of the same breed. . Almost fainting with horror, I tried to stealthily slip away but failed miserably. Cornered as Captain Haddock was by Jolyon Wagg, I was offered policy after policy starting with sensible ones such as recession to totally bizarre ones like attendance policy where my attendance shortage would lead to me getting money. Though it was tempting, I hastily refused reasoning that I was yet to earn any money and would definitely contact him or his brethren whenever I felt in need of one. . I was regaled with stories of his success tales, the number of lives that he had saved and so on. I was expecting to hear some stories of his Uncle Anatole too, but was mercifully spared. Soon I found that the entire train was packed with LIC agents apparently going to Delhi for some summit and most were looking for some prey en route. Students particularly broke ones like me didn’t interest them and they thankfully left me alone. I of course got my fair share of offers before they came to know of my situation. . All too soon the train reached Delhi and I bade a hearty farewell to my journey-mates whom I realised were not as dangerous as they are made up to be (somewhat like the proverbial dog who barks loudly). But maybe my being a non-earner may have contributed to their apparent tameness. I know this comes very late but I wanted to write something and this was the first thing that came to my mind.

A firm believer in God, I believe it is a test that He has posed before me to test my belief in Him. Will I be able to survive the torrent of emotions flooding through me and raising doubts again and again in my mind about his existence and still remain a believer? This “Agnipareeksha” that He has set before me may prove to be too much. . Why is it that whenever we become a bit too happy, somewhat carefree, that He sends thunderbolts down into our lives to remind us that however valuable our lives are to us and our loved ones, it takes only a moment to take it away. I was in such a state before this calamity that has befallen. A life that has been so painstakingly nurtured and shaped is taken away in an instant leaving us gasping for breath at the brutality with which He “looks” after His creations. . Some may say “Vidhi” or “Yogam” to what has happened, but I ask why such things should happen at the instant that we are slightly happy. Had He planned it all in such a way that we are always on the edge, always asking ourselves whenever we are happy how long it is going to last. Is it how He wants His children to live? Great sayings are there about how we should only care about the moment we live and not about the future, but is it practical. The best that I have heard is “the past is history, the future is a m ystery, every moment that we live is a gift, that is why it is called Present”. That seems to be true for happiness also. Momentary happiness seems to be the only thing that we should take for granted. A gift, no a loan provided to us at a high interest rate, the mortgage being ours or our dear ones’ life, whichever we value more. Is he the biggest loan shark of them all? . Words particularly in a language foreign to me can never ever express the anguish inside me, yet I have to resort to words to convey my grief. Einstein said that God doesn’t play dice. I don’t know about this but one thing I am sure is that he does play cards and does not play fair. Holding all the aces up his sleeve, he feigns defeat, rather victory for us for one or two games. The poor ignorant fools that we are, we overestimate ourselves and raise the bets. And then in one fell swoop, a coup de grace, he ends it all. . That is all I can manage now.

            "content": "I am not much of a writer, so theoretically, I should not be experiencing Writer’s Block. Rather it should be “Not much of a Writer’s Block”. But whatever it is, I must say the effects are pretty much the same. I can’t think of anything sensible to write. If anyone finds this blog insensible and illogical, contact me, we can be good friends. So we start off. This time I will be telling about the hardships faced by an herbivore (junkivore would be more apt) in a carnivorous society. . Living all my life at home and occasional visits to the restaurant being with my parents, I had never faced the bias1 that vegetarians face. But once in college, the harsh reality became visible to my myopic eyes and I realised the magnitude of the bubble I was living in. The visits to restaurants began to become ordeals for a harmless grass-eater (eater not smoker) like me where I had to bear witness to my friends gorging on my fellow beings (sniff) while I had to sit helplessly watching an empty plate (sniff sniff) awaiting my vegetarian food to be cooked which for some weird reason takes longer to cook than all other animals. . Phew! That was a long sentence, but I guess you can understand the passion with which I am writing this. Even after all that wait, the dish that comes will be cauliflower, which happens to be the “state north-Indian vegetable” (read: only dish; Gobi Manchurian, Gobi fry, chilli Gobi… the list goes on) of Kerala. . The ordeal still doesn’t end. By this time the rest of the food would have finished and then I have to suffer the ignominy of having my food being handled around by still-hungry people. I had heard that community eating, where an entire family eats from a single plate, was present in Iran or some other country. I have to tell you my dear friends; the custom is rampant in our dear motherland itself. It is prevalent in every single college of India too (at least in mine). My plate then becomes a battleground where the rest of the meat-eaters fight it out using their blood-stained hands while I shake my head in despair trying to believe that I am still a vegetarian, though my food may have been tainted by blood. . If I thought that this bias was only in a mainly non-vegetarian Kerala, then I was sorely mistaken. I was made aware of the extreme stupidity of my assumption on a recent visit to Tambiland (as my dear friend Arun says). It was a branch tour and I was among the few vegetarians in the trip. There again I was met with the same hardships that I faced in God’s Own Country. Veg. Fried rice with chicken in it, a funny look on the waiter’s face when I told that I was vegetarian (was it pity I am yet unsure), waiting endlessly for paneer to come while chicken came hours back, these were just a few of my problems. . I almost lost my vegetarian virginity (:-) based on my assumption, nay hope that I have not yet consumed any flesh), several times, once with the previously mentioned chicken veg. fried rice incident, another when I got chicken parantha instead of aloo parantha (the worst part was that I had to fight for my 5 Rs aloo parantha instead of the 20 Rs chicken parantha, which resulted in the MC guy starting to doubt my sanity) and God alone knows how many other times. . This outburst comes at a time when I have completed a score successfully (Happy Birthday to me!!!) as a vegetarian (or lacto-ova-vegetarian for the purists (a naive assumption no doubt)). Of course, a major majority was spent in the safety of home. . Each coming day is now a struggle between me and the rest of the world as I try my level best to remain a vegan2. I will be celebrating each vegan day with renewed vigour as I remain a member of the slowly becoming-extinct species of vegetarians. So protect me, campaign for me, make me a poster boy (bring on the cheerleaders) and vote for me. Grandma, and mom this one is for you for inspiring me to remain a vegan. . Have I got over my “Not much of a writer’s block”? No idea. . PS: The braces are back with a bang. PPS: Life would be boring without exaggerations. PPPS: This last PS is just for you 4. Just to odd things out. . 1 Vegetarian life is very comfortable, no one will kill you for eating the wrong meat 2 I thought vegan and vegetarian meant the same thing, I was old and foolish .",

            "content": "Hello everyone, this time your favourite programme “Weirdos around the World” brings you “The Ancient Disease and the Weird Kid”. The people mentioned in this programme are not fictional. Resemblance to any living or dead people is deliberate and aimed at spreading awareness about a really dangerous disease. . Act 1 Scene 1 Year 2009 AD. In a small village in a remote part of a remote state of a remote country, a class on circuits is going on. As we zoom in, we notice the entire class listening to every word that the teacher says.The entire class? No! One person is resisting the valiant attempts by the teacher to enlighten the souls. The one nose that is touching the notebook, but not writing anything belongs to our protagonist who is sleeping. Is he the Chosen One, the one person aware of the complex web of deception and lies surrounding mankind, or is he just an ordinary person who was up all night playing on his computer? We are yet to find the answer. . Scene 2 The class is finally over. Over the course of the interval, we hear our protagonist and the Showkuttan in a heated discussion, making repeated references to “blink-strikes” and “razor” and such weird stuff. It appears that our protagonist is discussing some serious stuff with his friend. Have the Volgons finally decide to make their highway? Or is it a new score-threatening disease that has infected certain members of another branch which eventually leads to a tendency to speak wierd words, and being cut off from the rest of the civilization and living only among the infected while discussing about vegetable-like creatures crawling over their computers. Again we are yet to find our answer. . Scene 3 Things are getting clearer. It appears that a new disease is spreading over the college. From observer reports, the disease spreads when people enter a certain room where everyone is infected by it. The onset is gradual, with an increased interest in weird looking things, a tendency to meet with the infected people and to discuss weird strategies all the while making extremely irritating sounds. Soon it develops into its frightening self in which the infected person loses interest in everything else and thinks only about the strategies for his next clan or pub…( is it something related to drinking?). At first, the others did not take any notice of this group, which was a very small minority. But as people began moving away from “respectable” activities like killing terrorists and leading armies to victories, the group began to be looked upon with contempt and dislike. The reports are gradually coming in and we expect to get a more detailed report soon. . Act 2 Scene 1 It has been confirmed. Our protagonist and his curly haired friend are infected members of the disease of which even the bravest of hearts are afraid of speaking aloud, lest they invoke the wrath of the “Ancients”. Everyone looks on the other with suspicion, fearing contact with an “infected”. Apparently, after the onset, extreme side-effects are there, including making extremely poor jokes, thinking of strategies even while eating, an inability to concentrate on anything else but the computer screen and a steady depreciation in the General Public Awareness. The cure is extremely difficult as the infected are no longer willing to cooperate, living in their own world, appearing to enjoy themselves, but decaying from within. . Scene 2 We meet the Crocodile, the Bird and the Chauvinist, the leaders of the curers, the few who are aware of the methods involved in curing an infected. They are discussing the latest defections. The loss of our protagonist, a person weak at heart, but a good person nevertheless, has sorely struck them, as is evident from their haggard faces. Though they are aware of the fact that the infected are still a minority, the increasing number of defections has given them a worried air. Their contempt towards the infected is matched only by their sympathy towards them and they are trying their very best to bring back the ones they have lost. . Scene 3 We finally manage to meet the protagonist. This is an excerpt of the interview we had with him. We were extremely cautious while approaching him and took the necessary precautions so that this disease does not spread into the outside world through us. . Interviewer- So tell us, when did you first come in contact with a person who was infected? Protagonist- Well… things of the past are a bit hazy in my memory. I think it was in my second year. Ya, I remember very clearly, I had gone to my friends room to call him for a quiz club meeting without knowing that he was an infected. I- When did things get worse? P- (thinks a lot) Well, after that I always had an urge to go that room and talk with them. Soon I was never in my room and always outside. Since even in my first year, I was not in my room, I did not consider that unusual, but then gradually I began to stay in that room all the time and talk about “You Know What” only. I would sit for hours watching a moving screen and talk with Showkuttan about “You Know What” only. I- So when did you realize that things were not normal anymore? P- Errr… when I began to talk about “You Know What” to everyone around me, even to perfect strangers, I started feeling that something was wrong somewhere. I- What happened then? P- When I started thinking about it even during exam time, I felt that things had gone overboard and approached my friends for help. But they just told that it was only a game and nothing more. I don’t blame them as they could not have guessed the a cuteness of my condition. I can’t remember much else. I have to go now. If you know anyone who can cure me, please help….. . We make a hasty escape from theplace before any of us contracted the disease. That’s All Folks… Next episode, “The Kid who ate his Homework” .",

As much as I enjoy college life, there is a sad feeling on thinking of stupid timetables, washing your own clothes and in short being responsible for yourself (The second one never fails to evoke a groan). . The first time at the college was particularly sad. The warmth of my mother’s hug where I always secure, father’s presence where there becomes nothing to worry about as it will always be solved, and my little sister with whom I fight every single moment but whom I can’t let anyone else hurt, all were part of my first journey to the college. . Well all this went into the backseat of my mind after the first few days, the “making friends” period, but it will always remain there. Though all this sounds cliched, it is true nevertheless. I guess this is all part of the “Growing Up”. A big part of my heart wishes that I was back to my school days, where the only thing that was to be worried about was the next exam. Even now, our lives are relatively sheltered, except that we are away from our parents. But come a day, when every morning has new worries, new bills to pay, then maybe college life will seem heavenly. . Well, one can’t really blame a human for always wanting something which he doesn’t have, its only human. The same forlorn feeling has come back to haunt me though it will be my third year into college. But leaving sentimental matters aside, this year is going to be the year when the future will be decided, whether I will be just another casualty to recession or a young man with a bright future. Of course placements come only next year but the buildup to it is important. Working hard seems to be the only option available, something which I incidentally despise, but what else can be done. This is a short farewell to blogosphere as once in college, I leave Roci behind and have to wait till I get a laptop, which I hope is quite soon. Or else I have to turn to my roomies who I trust will be “Friends in need…”. . Finishing my adieu with the great words of a great man… . The Road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the Road has gone, And I must follow, if I can, Pursuing it with weary feet, Until it joins some larger way, Where many paths and errands meet. And whither then? I cannot say. .

Doing the same work all day long, is for robots or machines in my opinion. If I was there only for a few hours, then they would have undoubtedly shown their professional side,but being there for the entire day, they must have decided to drop the act. C’mon, how long can a person keep up an act?!! So I could witness the Behind the Scenes action, the timed work, the untimed breaks, the small fights and of course, the inevitable boss-bashing.

            "content": "One of my fondest memories of my childhood is of my dear father reading me books. He used to insist that I read a paragraph and then would read me the rest. The usual fare was Asterix, Tintin, and all. While reading, he used to give different voices to the characters which somehow always sounded to be perfect for the character, like a deep voice for Obelix, a nice voice for Asterix, and an angry voice for the inimitable Captain Haddock. Thus began my love affair with books and I have to thank my Achhan for that. When talking about comics, Asterix has always been the first one that pops into my mind. Being illiterate in French, I have only read the English version, but original or not, the books are imba. Whether it is the naming of the characters or the double or sometimes triple meanings in the dialogues, everything leaves a mark. Whether the fights between Unhygeinix and Fulliautomatix or the sarcastic comments about Geriatrix’s age, the dialogues are just too good. And when it comes to Tintin, another of my favourites, Captain Haddock is the first thing that springs to my mind along with his choiciest swearwords. Talking about swearwords. Billions of Blue Blistering Barnacles, look at the time!!! Have to sleep now. Thats all Folks Toodles . PS: Forgot to mention the fact that I almost completely solved yesterdays crossword. But if the brainiacs at Hindu get even a whiff of the fact that I found it to be easy, they make it ultra-hard next time. Still hoping for an easy one. .",

The usual stuff – got bored to death, missing my parents and my little sis, reading books etc. I was supposed to be studying about telephones last week. But who cares about stupid phones. Me and the person who was in charge of me, ended up discussing everything else but phones! . I am really interested in the origin of everything. So we also talked about the origin of the different religious practices. My grandma, an authority on the subject is my source of information, and I always pester her about it. It is fascinating to know that most of the practices in fact, have very scientific reasons. Hence it is really sad to see the constant conflict between the religious and scientific leaders when both are just different paths to reach the same truth. . Two roads diverged in a yellow wood…. . Science in a nutshell is to study nature, so is religion. Though my knowledge about both is insignificant, I think that in the end both religion and science are about harmonizing with nature. . The true power about a man in harmony with nature was demonstrated by a scientist-turned-preacher from I-don’t-know-where. He could pass almost a million volts of electricity through his body with the only hurt coming due to the burn caused by the high voltage. The electricity did not hurt him because it was at the resonant frequency of his body. . This is similar to the concept that I mentioned in one of my previous blog about the nature of magic, about being in peace with oneself. I know, I have a tendency to drift to HP at the least given chance. But HP aside, the concept is truly fantastic- about being in harmony with nature. .

There is something about being bored that brings out the best in a person and he digs deep into his creativity to escape his plight. But Yours Truly has defied this convention and has slept more and more. It is during these sleep-induced stupors that I became philosophical and began wondering why I am doing all this. I desperately wanted an answer. . But then I read Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and my whole viewpoint changed. Douglas Adams has pointed out in a rather hilarious way that instead of searching for answers to everything, we should first search for the proper questions. He has ridiculed how everyone wants the Ultimate Answer without knowing the Ultimate Question. An answer, however elegantly phrased, is incomplete without the right question. Mr Adams imagines the earth to be a gigantic computer aimed at finding the UQ. His point of view that human beings are the real guinea-pigs in this universal experiment is quite reasonable. The UQ has to be reached at by asking smaller significant questions on the way. . It is this ability to ask questions that make humans what they are. A child asks questions to everthing,but as we grow up we ask lesser and lesser questions, thereby losing our way to the UQ. Our pride and other petty feelings come in the way of our natural curiosity and block our path. Those who ask questions throughout their lives become great. .

The innocent fool I was, I did not read the fine print too carefully and did not read the “*-terms and conditions apply”.

Soon I became a Kumbhakarna waking up only the day of the examination to go there, finish it as early as possible and continue my forty winks. .

Apparently, early morning awakenings were only when the situation warranted it. According to Mr. Sleep, that meant the morning of the examination.

He says “Young man, y pages are still left”. Inevitably I win, but the bigger the book, the longer the contest goes on. Though I thoroughly enjoy this “War of words”, two people are not at all pleased at this. One is of course my mother as I tend to forget everything with a book in my hand. The other person is Mr. Hunger who also gets forgotten. And he gets really angry at that. So he hits back really hard. Then it is left to my mother to do the damage control (which further fuels her anger). . My addiction doesn’t stop at books. I am also addicted to computers. So I have clubbed the two and begun to read e-books. I agree, of course, that a computer can never substitute a book, but still beggars can’t be choosers. During the furore around the time of release of HPDH, I was madly searching the net for the supposedly leaked copies (sorry JKR). During that time I read many fanfictions and of course the brilliant spoof. I daresay the spoof was better than the original (of course minus the sex part in the spoof, not that I have anything against sex, but somehow Harry Potter and sex don’t seem to mix). . Another good fan-fiction that I read was posted on Sugarquill. It was for the Order of the Pheonix. I have always felt that HP was sadly lacking in duels ever since Dumbledore and Voldy gave us a taste of it. But this book has some scintillating duels and some fantastic concepts. You may wonder that haven’t I outgrown HP. But there is something about magic which keeps me spellbound (no pun intended). . Instead of focussing on what magic is being used to do, the author has focussed upon the nature of magic. She has categorised magic into two types, dormant which is called Aether and moving which is called Numen. She says that the aether is converted into numen when it moves through our heart (which acts like a prism). For any magic to be done, the heart has to be willing. Quoting her, “there are no dark arts, only dark hearts”. So a person who is at peace with himself can convert all the numen back into aether (like an inverted prism). That, I think is a fantastic concept. Any jobless person who is interested should go to Sugarquill and search for Pheonix and the Serpent. . But have to go now, my best friend sleep is calling me. .

Come on, PCBs (and monster ones at that) can only be so much interesting. . Other than the Hindu Crossword (HC), this is my only respite. I have been an avid fan of crosswords ever since my father started doing them. Since the Sudoku in every newspaper available would have been solved by my grandma at the crack of dawn, I have to make do with HC. Also if the sudoku happens to be tough, then I have to wait till it is finished (as grandma dear would rather disown me than miss a sudoku).

Quoting Dumbledore, “For the prepared mind, Blogging is but the next great adventure”, so I am become the Quixote of La Palakkad with my prehistoric comp as my Rocinante, fighting all ye evil bloggers and readers along with my trusty Sancho (read no one). I wonder when I will meet my Dulcinea. But then I am digressing (as I promised). So back to the story. I may write anything and everything that comes to my mind, so beware! Signing off for now, promising even more disoriented blogs. . PS: I like braces (paranthesis for the purer minds). Expect lots of them. If you don’t like them just read without them. Don’t ask me how, thats your problem. (((())))) (just to drive in the matter) .",
